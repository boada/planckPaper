\section{Introduction} 
Throughout this paper, we adopt the following cosmological model from the Buzzard simulations: $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.714$, $\Omega_M = 0.286$, and $H_0= 70$ \kms \mpc, assume a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF; \citealt{Chabrier2003}), and use AB magnitudes \citep{Oke1974}.
