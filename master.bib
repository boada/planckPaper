abstract = {We present 1-2 arcmin spatial resolution CARMA-8 31-GHz observations towards 19 unconfirmed Planck cluster candidates, selected to have significant galaxy overdensities from the WISE early data release and thought to be at z{\textgreater}1 from the WISE colors of the putative brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We find a Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) detection in the CARMA-8 data towards 9 candidate clusters, where one detection is considered tentative. For each cluster candidate we present CARMA-8 maps, a study of their radio-source environment and we assess the reliability of the SZ detection. The CARMA SZ detections appear to be SZ-bright, with the mean, primary-beam-corrected peak flux density of the decrement being -2.9mJy/beam with a standard deviation of 0.8, and are typically offset from the Planck position by approximately 80 arcsec. Using archival imaging data in the vicinity of the CARMA SZ centroids, we present evidence that one cluster matches Abell 586-a known z{\~{}}0.2 cluster; four candidate clusters are likely to have 0.3{\textless}z{\textless}0.7; and, for the remaining 4, the redshift information is inconclusive. We also argue that the sensitivity limits resulting from the cross-correlation between Planck and WISE makes it challenging to use our selection criterion to identify clusters at z {\textgreater} 1.},

abstract = {The dark matter halo mass function (HMF) is a characteristic property of cosmological structure formation models, quantifying the number density of dark matter haloes per unit mass in the Universe. A key goal of current and planned large galaxy surveys is to measure the HMF and to use it to test theories of dark matter and dark energy. We present a new web application for calculating the HMF -- the frontend HMFcalc and the engine hmf. HMFcalc has been designed to be flexible, efficient and easy to use, providing observational and theoretical astronomers alike with the means to explore standard functional forms of the HMF or to tailor their own. We outline the theoretical background needed to compute the HMF, we show how it has been implemented in hmf, and finally we provide worked examples that illustrate HMFcalc's versatility as an analysis tool.},

abstract = {We study the relationship between galaxy colour, stellar mass and local galaxy density in a deep near-infrared imaging survey up to a redshift of z˜ 3 using the GOODS (Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey) NICMOS (Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer) Survey (GNS). The GNS is a deep near-infrared Hubble Space Telescope survey imaging a total of 45 arcmin2 of the GOODS fields, reaching a stellar mass completeness limit of M*= 109.5 M⊙ at z= 3. Using these data, we measure galaxy local densities based on galaxy counts within a fixed aperture, as well as the distance to the third, fifth and seventh nearest neighbour. We compare the average rest-frame (U-B) colour and fraction of blue galaxies in different local densities and at different stellar masses. We find a strong correlation between colour and stellar mass at all redshifts up to z˜ 3. Massive red galaxies are already in place at z˜ 3 at the expected location of the red sequence in the colour-magnitude diagram, although they are star forming. We do not find a strong correlation between colour and local density; however, there may be evidence that the highest overdensities are populated by a higher fraction of blue galaxies than average or underdense areas. This could be indicating that the colour-density relation at high redshift is reversed with respect to lower redshifts (z {\textless} 1), where higher densities are found to have lower blue fractions. Our data suggest that the possible higher blue fraction at extreme overdensities might be due to a lack of massive red galaxies at the highest local densities.},

abstract = {Using galaxy clusters from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey, we study how the distribution of galaxies along the colour-magnitude relation has evolved since z{\~{}}0.8. While red-sequence galaxies in all these clusters are well described by an old, passively evolving population, we confirm our previous finding of a significant evolution in their luminosity distribution as a function of redshift. When compared to galaxy clusters in the local Universe, the high redshift EDisCS clusters exhibit a significant "deficit" of faint red galaxies. Combining clusters in three different redshift bins, and defining as `faint' all galaxies in the range 0.4 {\textgreater} L/L* {\textgreater} 0.1, we find a clear decrease in the luminous-to-faint ratio of red galaxies from z{\~{}}0.8 to z{\~{}}0.4. The amount of such a decrease appears to be in qualitative agreement with predictions of a model where the blue bright galaxies that populate the colour-magnitude diagram of high redshift clusters, have their star formation suppressed by the hostile cluster environment. Although model results need to be interpreted with caution, our findings clearly indicate that the red-sequence population of high-redshift clusters does not contain all progenitors of nearby red-sequence cluster galaxies. A significant fraction of these must have moved onto the red-sequence below z{\~{}}0.8.},

abstract = {Massive galaxies in the young Universe, ten billion years ago, formed stars at surprising intensities. Although this is commonly attributed to violent mergers, the properties of many of these galaxies are incompatible with such events, showing gas-rich, clumpy, extended rotating disks not dominated by spheroids. Cosmological simulations and clustering theory are used to explore how these galaxies acquired their gas. Here we report that they are 'stream-fed galaxies', formed from steady, narrow, cold gas streams that penetrate the shock-heated media of massive dark matter haloes. A comparison with the observed abundance of star-forming galaxies implies that most of the input gas must rapidly convert to stars. One-third of the stream mass is in gas clumps leading to mergers of mass ratio greater than 1:10, and the rest is in smoother flows. With a merger duty cycle of 0.1, three-quarters of the galaxies forming stars at a given rate are fed by smooth streams. The rarer, submillimetre galaxies that form stars even more intensely are largely merger-induced starbursts. Unlike destructive mergers, the streams are likely to keep the rotating disk configuration intact, although turbulent and broken into giant star-forming clumps that merge into a central spheroid. This stream-driven scenario for the formation of discs and spheroids is an alternative to the merger picture.},

abstract = {We study dynamical mass measurements of galaxy clusters contaminated by interlopers and show that a modern machine learning (ML) algorithm can predict masses by better than a factor of two compared to a standard scaling relation approach. We create two mock catalogs from Multidark's publicly-available N-body MDPL1 simulation, one with perfect galaxy cluster membership information and the other where a simple cylindrical cut around the cluster center allows interlopers to contaminate the clusters. In the standard approach, we use a power law scaling relation to infer cluster mass from galaxy line of sight (LOS) velocity dispersion. Assuming perfect membership knowledge, this unrealistic case produces a wide fractional mass error distribution, with width = 0.87. Interlopers introduce additional scatter, significantly widening the error distribution further (width = 2.13). We employ the Support Distribution Machine (SDM) class of algorithms to learn from distributions of data to predict single values. Applied to distributions of galaxy observables such as LOS velocity and projected distance from the cluster center, SDM yields better than a factor-of-two improvement (width = 0.67). Remarkably, SDM applied to contaminated clusters is better able to recover masses than even the scaling relation approach applied to uncontaminated clusters. We show that the SDM method more accurately reproduces the cluster mass function, making it a valuable tool for employing cluster observations to evaluate cosmological models.},

abstract = {We measure the topology of volume-limited galaxy samples selected from a parent sample of 314,050 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey(SDSS), which is now complete enough to describe the fully three-dimensional topology and its dependence on galaxy properties. We compare the observed genus statistic G$\backslash$nu{\_}f) to predictions for a Gaussian random field and to the genus measured for mock surveys constructed from new large-volume simulations of the LambdaCDM cosmology. In this analysis we carefully examine the dependence of the observed genus statistic on the Gaussian smoothing scale R{\_}G from 3.5 to 11 h{\^{}}-1Mpc and on the luminosity of galaxies over the range -22.50{\textless}M{\_}r{\textless}-18.5. The void multiplicity A{\_}V is less than unity at all smoothing scales. Because A{\_}V cannot become less than 1 through gravitational evolution, this result provides strong evidence for biased galaxy formation in low density environments. We also find clear evidence of luminosity bias of topology within the volume-limited sub-samples. The shift parameter Delta nu indicates that the genus of brighter galaxies shows a negative shift toward a ``meatball'' (i.e. cluster-dominated) topology, while faint galaxies show a positive shift toward a ``bubble'' (i.e. void-dominated) topology. The transition from negative to positive shift occurs approximately at the characteristic absolute magnitude M{\_}{\{}r*{\}}=-20.4. Even in this analysis of the largest galaxy sample to date, we detect the influence of individual large-scale structures, as the shift parameter Delta nu and cluster multiplicity A{\_}C reflect (at {\~{}}3 sigma) the presence of the Sloan Great Wall and a X-shaped structure which runs for several hundred Mpc across the survey volume.},

abstract = {The spatial, kinematic, and elemental-abundance structure of the Milky Way's stellar disk is complex, and has been difficult to dissect with local spectroscopic or global photometric data. Here, we develop and apply a rigorous density modeling approach for Galactic spectroscopic surveys that enables investigation of the global spatial structure of stellar sub-populations in narrow bins of [alpha/Fe] and [Fe/H], using 23,767 G-type dwarfs from SDSS/SEGUE, which effectively sample 5 kpc {\textless} R GC {\textless} 12 kpc and 0.3 kpc {\textless}{\~{}} |Z| {\textless}{\~{}} 3 kpc. We fit models for the number density of each such ([alpha/Fe] and [Fe/H]) mono-abundance component, properly accounting for the complex spectroscopic SEGUE sampling of the underlying stellar population, as well as for the metallicity and color distributions of the samples. We find that each mono-abundance sub-population has a simple spatial structure that can be described by a single exponential in both the vertical and radial directions, with continuously increasing scale heights (≈200 pc to 1 kpc) and decreasing scale lengths ({\textgreater}4.5 kpc to 2 kpc) for increasingly older sub-populations, as indicated by their lower metallicities and [alpha/Fe] enhancements. That the abundance-selected sub-components with the largest scale heights have the shortest scale lengths is in sharp contrast with purely geometric "thick-thin disk" decompositions. To the extent that [alpha/Fe] is an adequate proxy for age, our results directly show that older disk sub-populations are more centrally concentrated, which implies inside-out formation of galactic disks. The fact that the largest scale-height sub-components are most centrally concentrated in the Milky Way is an almost inevitable consequence of explaining the vertical structure of the disk through internal evolution. Whether the simple spatial structure of the mono-abundance sub-components and the striking correlations between age, scale length, and scale height can be plausibly explained by satellite accretion or other external heating remains to be seen.},

abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of “dark energy” with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious efforts to understand its origin, with experiments that aim to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and the abundance of galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit “Stage IV” dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski effect, and direct measurements of the Hubble constant H0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from General Relativity, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background data. We also show the level of precision required for clusters or other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets that support a wide range of scientific investigations, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of galaxies in the CDF-South. We find a tight relation to z=3 between color and size at a given mass, with red galaxies being small, and blue galaxies being large. We show that the relation is driven by stellar surface density or inferred velocity dispersion: galaxies with high surface density are red and have low specific star formation rates, and galaxies with low surface density are blue and have high specific star formation rates. Surface density and inferred velocity dispersion are better correlated with specific star formation rate and color than stellar mass. Hence stellar mass by itself is not a good predictor of the star formation history of galaxies. In general, galaxies at a given surface density have higher specific star formation rates at higher redshift. Specifically, galaxies with a surface density of (1-3)×109 Msolar kpc-2 are ``red and dead'' at low redshift, approximately 50{\%} are forming stars at z=1, and almost all are forming stars by z=2. This provides direct additional evidence for the late evolution of galaxies onto the red sequence. The sizes of galaxies at a given mass evolve like 1/(1+z)0.59+/-0.10. Hence galaxies undergo significant upsizing in their history. The size evolution is fastest for the highest mass galaxies and quiescent galaxies. The persistence of the structural relations from z=0 to z=2.5, and the upsizing of galaxies imply that a relation analogous to the Hubble sequence exists out to z=2.5, and possibly beyond. The star-forming galaxies at z{\textgreater}=1.5 are quite different from star-forming galaxies at z=0, as they have likely very high gas fractions, and star formation timescales comparable to the orbital time.

abstract = {We employ robust weak gravitational lensing measurements to improve cosmological constraints from measurements of the galaxy cluster mass function and its evolution, using X-ray selected clusters detected in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. Our lensing analysis constrains the absolute mass scale of such clusters at the 8 per cent level, including both statistical and systematic uncertainties. Combining it with the survey data and X-ray follow-up observations, we find a tight constraint on a combination of the mean matter density and late-time normalization of the matter power spectrum, $\sigma$8($\Omega$m/0.3)0.17 = 0.81 ± 0.03, with marginalized, one-dimensional constraints of $\Omega$m = 0.26 ± 0.03 and $\sigma$8 = 0.83 ± 0.04. For these two parameters, this represents a factor of 2 improvement in precision with respect to previous work, primarily due to the reduced systematic uncertainty in the absolute mass calibration provided by the lensing analysis. Our new results are in good agreement with constraints from cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, both Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and Planck (plus WMAP polarization), under the assumption of a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with minimal neutrino mass. Consequently, we find no evidence for non-minimal neutrino mass from the combination of cluster data with CMB, supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, regardless of which all-sky CMB data set is used (and independent of the recent claimed detection of B modes on degree scales). We also present improved constraints on models of dark energy (both constant and evolving), modifications of gravity, and primordial non-Gaussianity. Assuming flatness, the constraints for a constant dark energy equation of state from the cluster data alone are at the 15 per cent level, improving to ˜6 per cent when the cluster data are combined with other leading probes.},

abstract = {The dynamical state of galaxy groups at intermediate redshifts can provide information about the growth of structure in the universe. We examine three goodness-of-fit tests, the Anderson-Darling (A-D), Kolmogorov, and $\chi$2 tests, in order to determine which statistical tool is best able to distinguish between groups that are relaxed and those that are dynamically complex. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of these three tests and show that the $\chi$2 test is profoundly unreliable for groups with fewer than 30 members. Power studies of the Kolmogorov and A-D tests are conducted to test their robustness for various sample sizes. We then apply these tests to a sample of the second Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Redshift Survey (CNOC2) galaxy groups and find that the A-D test is far more reliable and powerful at detecting real departures from an underlying Gaussian distribution than the more commonly used $\chi$2 and Kolmogorov tests. We use this statistic to classify a sample of the CNOC2 groups and find that 34 of 106 groups are inconsistent with an underlying Gaussian velocity distribution, and thus do not appear relaxed. In addition, we compute velocity dispersion profiles (VDPs) for all groups with more than 20 members and compare the overall features of the Gaussian and non-Gaussian groups, finding that the VDPs of the non-Gaussian groups are distinct from those classified as Gaussian.},

abstract = {For low-redshift cosmology and galaxy formation rates, it is important to account for all the baryons synthesized in the Big Bang. Although galaxies and clusters contain 10{\%} of the baryons, many more reside in the photoionized Lyman-alpha forest and shocked-heated warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) at T = 10{\^{}}5 to 10{\^{}}7 K. Current tracers of WHIM at 10{\^{}}5 to 10{\^{}}6 K include the O VI 1032, 1038 absorption lines, together with broad Lyman-alpha absorbers (BLAs) and EUV/X-ray absorption lines from Ne VIII, O VII, and O VIII. We improve the O VI baryon surveys with corrections for oxygen metallicity (Z/Zsun) and O VI ionization fraction (f{\_}OVI) using cosmological simulations of heating, cooling, and metal transport in a density-temperature structured medium. Statistically, their product correlates with column density, (Z/Zsun)(f{\_}OVI) = (0.015)(N{\_}OVI/10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}} cm{\^{}}-2){\^{}}0.70. The N{\_}OVI-weighted mean is 0.01, which doubles previous estimates of WHIM baryon content. We also reanalyze H I data from the Hubble Space Telescope, applying redshift corrections for absorber density, photoionizing background, and proper length, dl/dz. We find substantial baryon fractions in the photoionized Lya forest (28 +/- 11{\%}), O VI/BLA-traced WHIM (25 +/- 8{\%}), and collapsed phase (18 +/- 4{\%}) in galaxies, groups, clusters, and circumgalactic gas. The baryon shortfall is 29 +/- 13{\%}, which may be detected in X-ray absorbers from hotter WHIM or in weaker Lya and O VI absorbers. Further progress will require higher-precision baryon surveys of weak absorbers at column densities N{\_}HI {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}{\{}12.0{\}} cm{\^{}}-2, N{\_}OVI {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}{\{}12.5{\}} cm{\^{}}-2, and N{\_}OVII {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}{\{}14.5{\}} cm{\^{}}-2, with moderate-resolution UV and X-ray spectrographs.},

abstract = {Examining a sample of massive galaxies at 1.4{\textless}z{\textless}2.5 with KVega{\textless}22 from GOODS, we compare photometry from Spitzer at mid- and far-IR to submillimeter, radio, and rest-frame UV wavelengths, to test the agreement between different tracers of star formation rates (SFRs) and to explore the implications for galaxy assembly. For z{\~{}}2 galaxies with moderate luminosities (L8$\mu$m{\textless}1011 Lsolar), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However, 20{\%}-30{\%} of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L8$\mu$m{\textgreater}1011 Lsolar, show a mid-IR excess that is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 $\mu$m-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z=2 was larger by a factor of {\~{}}4 and {\~{}}30 relative to that in star-forming galaxies at z=1 and 0, respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z=2 are relatively ``transparent'' to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived ({\textgreater}{\~{}}400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high-redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation in massive galaxies at z=2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity. Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4 and the space density of ULIRGs by an order of magnitude but give better agreement for z{\textgreater}1.4 quiescent galaxies.},

abstract = {The Ly$\alpha$ emission line has been proven to be a powerful tool for studying evolving galaxies at the highest redshift. However, in order to use Ly$\alpha$ as a physical probe of galaxies, it becomes vital to know the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction (f Ly$\alpha$ esc). Unfortunately, due to the resonant nature of Ly$\alpha$, f Ly$\alpha$ esc may vary unpredictably and requires empirical measurement. Here, we compile Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions (LFs) between redshifts z = 0 and 8 and, combined with H$\alpha$ and ultraviolet data, assess how f Ly$\alpha$ esc evolves with redshift. We find a strong upward evolution in f Ly$\alpha$ esc over the range z = 0.3-6, which is well fit by the power law f Ly$\alpha$ escvprop(1 + z)$\xi$with $\xi$ = (2.57+0.19 -0.12). This predicts that f Ly$\alpha$ esc should reach unity at z = 11.1. By comparing f Ly$\alpha$ esc and E B-V in individual galaxies we derive an empirical relationship between f Ly$\alpha$ esc and E B-V , which includes resonance scattering and can explain the redshift evolution of f Ly$\alpha$ esc between z = 0 and 6 purely as a function of the evolution in the dust content of galaxies. Beyond z ≈ 6.5, f Ly$\alpha$ esc drops more substantially, an effect attributed to either ionizing photon leakage, or an increase in the neutral gas fraction of the intergalactic medium. While distinguishing between these two scenarios may be extremely challenging, by framing the problem this way we remove the uncertainty of the halo mass from Ly$\alpha$-based tests of reionization. We finally derive a new method by which to estimate the dust content of galaxies, based purely upon the observed Ly$\alpha$ and UV LFs. These data are characterized by an exponential with an e-folding scale of z EBV ≈ 3.4.},

abstract = {The presence of substructure in galaxy groups and clusters is believed to be a sign of recent galaxy accretion and can be used to probe not only the assembly history of these structures, but also the evolution of their member galaxies. Using the Dressler-Shectman (DS) test, we study substructure in a sample of intermediate-redshift (z˜ 0.4) galaxy groups from the Group Environment and Evolution Collaboration (GEEC) group catalogue. We find that four of the 15 rich GEEC groups, with an average velocity dispersion of ˜525 km s-1, are identified as having significant substructure. The identified regions of localized substructure lie on the group outskirts and in some cases appear to be infalling. In a comparison of galaxy properties for the members of groups with and without substructure, we find that the groups with substructure have a significantly higher fraction of blue and star-forming galaxies and a parent colour distribution that resembles that of the field population rather than the overall group population. In addition, we observe correlations between the detection of substructure and other dynamical measures, such as velocity distributions and velocity dispersion profiles. Based on this analysis, we conclude that some galaxy groups contain significant substructure and that these groups have properties and galaxy populations that differ from groups with no detected substructure. These results indicate that the substructure galaxies, which lie preferentially on the group outskirts and could be infalling, do not exhibit signs of environmental effects, since little or no star formation quenching is observed in these systems.},

These clusters, along with one unconfirmed candidate, were identified in 178 deg2 of sky surveyed in 2008 by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) to a depth of 18 $\mu$K arcmin at 150 GHz. Optical imaging from the Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS) and Magellan telescopes provided photometric (and in some cases spectroscopic) redshift estimates, with catalog redshifts ranging from z = 0.15 to z{\textgreater}1, with a median z = 0.74. Of the 21 confirmed galaxy clusters, 3 were previously identified as Abell clusters, 3 were presented as SPT discoveries in Staniszewski et al., and 3 were first identified in a recent analysis of BCS data by Menanteau et al. the remaining 12 clusters are presented for the first time in this work. Simulated observations of the SPT fields predict the sample to be nearly 100{\%} complete above a mass threshold of M 200 ≈ 5 × 1014 M sun h -1 at z = 0.6. This completeness threshold pushes to lower mass with increasing redshift, dropping to {\~{}}4 × 1014 M sun h -1 at z = 1. The size and redshift distribution of this catalog are in good agreement with expectations based on our current understanding of galaxy clusters and cosmology. In combination with other cosmological probes, we use this cluster catalog to improve estimates of cosmological parameters. Assuming a standard spatially flat wCDM cosmological model, the addition of our catalog to the WMAP seven-year results yields $\sigma$8 = 0.81 ± 0.09 and w = -1.07 ± 0.29, a {\~{}}50{\%} improvement in precision on both parameters over WMAP7 alone.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the relation between the masses of cluster- and group-sized haloes, extracted from $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological N-body and hydrodynamic simulations, and their velocity dispersion at different redshifts from z = 2 to 0. The main aim of this analysis is to understand how the implementation of baryonic physics in simulations affects such relations, i.e. to what extent the use of the velocity dispersion as a proxy for cluster mass determination is hampered by the imperfect knowledge of the baryonic physics. In our analysis, we use several sets of simulations with different physics implemented: one DM-only simulation, one simulation with non-radiative gas, and two radiative simulations, one of which with feedback from active galactic nuclei. Velocity dispersions are determined using three different tracers: DM particles, subhaloes and galaxies. We confirm that DM particles trace a relation that is fully consistent with the theoretical expectations based on the virial theorem, $\sigma$v ∝ M$\alpha$ with $\alpha$ = 1/3, and with previous results presented in the literature. On the other hand, subhaloes and galaxies trace steeper relations, with velocity dispersion scaling with mass with $\alpha$ {\textgreater} 1/3, and with larger values of the normalization. Such relations imply that galaxies and subhaloes have a ˜10 per cent velocity bias relative to the DM particles, which can be either positive or negative, depending on the halo mass, redshift and physics implemented in the simulation. We explain these differences as due to dynamical processes, namely dynamical friction and tidal disruption, acting on substructures and galaxies, but not on DM particles. These processes appear to be more or less effective, depending on the halo masses and the importance of baryon cooling, and may create a non-trivial dependence of the velocity bias and the $\sigma$1D-M200 relation on the tracer, the halo mass and its redshift. These results are relevant in view of the application of velocity dispersion as a proxy for cluster masses in ongoing and future large redshift surveys.},

abstract = {We present galaxy velocity dispersions and dynamical mass estimates for 44 galaxy clusters selected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. Dynamical masses for 18 clusters are reported here for the first time. Using N-body simulations, we model the different observing strategies used to measure the velocity dispersions and account for systematic effects resulting from these strategies. We find that the galaxy velocity distributions may be treated as isotropic, and that an aperture correction of up to 7 per cent in the velocity dispersion is required if the spectroscopic galaxy sample is sufficiently concentrated towards the cluster centre. Accounting for the radial profile of the velocity dispersion in simulations enables consistent dynamical mass estimates regardless of the observing strategy. Cluster masses {\$}M{\_}{\{}200{\}}{\$} are in the range {\$}(1-15)\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. Comparing with masses estimated from the SZ distortion assuming a gas pressure profile derived from X-ray observations gives a mean SZ-to-dynamical mass ratio of {\$}1.10\backslashpm0.13{\$}, consistent with previous determinations at these mass scales.},

abstract = {We describe redMaPPer, a new red sequence cluster finder specifically designed to make optimal use of ongoing and near-future large photometric surveys. The algorithm has multiple attractive features: (1) it can iteratively self-train the red sequence model based on a minimal spectroscopic training sample, an important feature for high-redshift surveys. (2) It can handle complex masks with varying depth. (3) It produces cluster-appropriate random points to enable large-scale structure studies. (4) All clusters are assigned a full redshift probability distribution P(z). (5) Similarly, clusters can have multiple candidate central galaxies, each with corresponding centering probabilities. (6) The algorithm is parallel and numerically efficient: it can run a Dark Energy Survey-like catalog in {\~{}}500 CPU hours. (7) The algorithm exhibits excellent photometric redshift performance, the richness estimates are tightly correlated with external mass proxies, and the completeness and purity of the corresponding catalogs are superb. We apply the redMaPPer algorithm to {\~{}}10, 000 deg2 of SDSS DR8 data and present the resulting catalog of {\~{}}25,000 clusters over the redshift range z in [0.08, 0.55]. The redMaPPer photometric redshifts are nearly Gaussian, with a scatter $\sigma$ z ≈ 0.006 at z ≈ 0.1, increasing to $\sigma$ z ≈ 0.02 at z ≈ 0.5 due to increased photometric noise near the survey limit. The median value for |$\Delta$z|/(1 + z) for the full sample is 0.006. The incidence of projection effects is low ({\textless}=5{\%}). Detailed performance comparisons of the redMaPPer DR8 cluster catalog to X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich catalogs are presented in a companion paper.},

abstract = {We use the kinematics of satellite galaxies that orbit around the central galaxy in a dark matter halo to infer the scaling relations between halo mass and central galaxy properties. Using galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we investigate the halo mass-luminosity relation (MLR) and the halo mass-stellar mass relation (MSR) of central galaxies. In particular, we focus on the dependence of these scaling relations on the colour of the central galaxy. We find that red central galaxies on average occupy more massive haloes than blue central galaxies of the same luminosity. However, at fixed stellar mass there is no appreciable difference in the average halo mass of red and blue centrals, especially for M*≲ 1010.5 h-2 M⊙. This indicates that stellar mass is a better indicator of halo mass than luminosity. Nevertheless, we find that the scatter in halo masses at fixed stellar mass is non-negligible for both red and blue centrals. It increases as a function of stellar mass for red centrals but shows a fairly constant behaviour for blue centrals. We compare the scaling relations obtained in this paper with results from other independent studies of satellite kinematics, with results from a SDSS galaxy group catalog, from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements and from subhalo abundance matching studies. Overall, these different techniques yield MLRs and MSRs in fairly good agreement with each other (typically within a factor of 2), indicating that we are converging on an accurate and reliable description of the galaxy-dark matter connection. We briefly discuss some of the remaining discrepancies among the various methods.},

abstract = {We present the results of SPT-GMOS, a spectroscopic survey with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on Gemini South. The targets of SPT-GMOS are galaxy clusters identified in the SPT-SZ survey, a millimeter-wave survey of 2500 squ. deg. of the southern sky using the South Pole Telescope (SPT). Multi-object spectroscopic observations of 62 SPT-selected galaxy clusters were performed between January 2011 and December 2015, yielding spectra with radial velocity measurements for 2595 sources. We identify 2243 of these sources as galaxies, and 352 as stars. Of the galaxies, we identify 1579 as members of SPT-SZ galaxy clusters. The primary goal of these observations was to obtain spectra of cluster member galaxies to estimate cluster redshifts and velocity dispersions. We describe the full spectroscopic dataset and resulting data products, including galaxy redshifts, cluster redshifts and velocity dispersions, and measurements of several well-known spectral indices for each galaxy: the equivalent width, W, of [O II] 3727,3729 and H-delta, and the 4000A break strength, D4000. We use the spectral indices to classify galaxies by spectral type (i.e., passive, post-starburst, star-forming), and we match the spectra against photometric catalogs to characterize spectroscopically-observed cluster members as a function of brightness (relative to m*). Finally, we report several new measurements of redshifts for ten bright, strongly-lensed background galaxies in the cores of eight galaxy clusters. Combining the SPT-GMOS dataset with previous spectroscopic follow-up of SPT-SZ galaxy clusters results in spectroscopic measurements for {\textgreater}100 clusters, or {\~{}}20{\%} of the full SPT-SZ sample.},

The well-defined IRAC samples contain 3800-5800 galaxies for the 3.6-8.0 micron bands with spectroscopic redshifts and z {\textless} 0.6. We obtained relatively complete luminosity functions in the local redshift bin of z {\textless} 0.2 for all four IRAC channels that are well fit by Schechter functions. We found significant evolution in the luminosity functions for all four IRAC channels that can be fit as an evolution in M* with redshift, $\backslash$Delta M* = Qz. While we measured Q=1.2$\backslash$pm0.4 and 1.1$\backslash$pm0.4 in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands consistent with the predictions from a passively evolving population, we obtained Q=1.8$\backslash$pm1.1 in the 8.0 micron band consistent with other evolving star formation rate estimates. We compared our LFs with the predictions of semi-analytical galaxy formation and found the best agreement at 3.6 and 4.5 micron, rough agreement at 8.0 micron, and a large mismatch at 5.8 micron. These models also predicted a comparable Q value to our luminosity functions at 8.0 micron, but predicted smaller values at 3.6 and 4.5 micron. We also measured the luminosity functions separately for early and late-type galaxies. While the luminosity functions of late-type galaxies resemble those for the total population, the luminosity functions of early-type galaxies in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands indicate deviations from the passive evolution model, especially from the measured flat luminosity density evolution. Combining our estimates with other measurements in the literature, we found (53$\backslash$pm18){\%} of the present stellar mass of early-type galaxies has been assembled at z=0.7.},

abstract = {The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical picture for the formation of structure in the Universe. This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,160(3) particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies.},

abstract = {This is the first of a series of papers in which we derive simultaneous constraints on cosmological parameters and X-ray scaling relations using observations of the growth of massive, X-ray flux-selected galaxy clusters. Our data set consists of 238 cluster detections from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, and incorporates follow-up observations of 94 of those clusters using the Chandra X-ray Observatory or ROSAT. Here we describe and implement a new statistical framework required to self-consistently produce simultaneous constraints on cosmology and scaling relations from such data, and present results on models of dark energy. In spatially flat models with a constant dark energy equation of state, w, the cluster data yield $\Omega$m = 0.23 +/- 0.04,$\sigma$8 = 0.82 +/- 0.05 and w = -1.01 +/- 0.20, incorporating standard priors on the Hubble parameter and mean baryon density of the Universe, and marginalizing over conservative allowances for systematic uncertainties. These constraints agree well and are competitive with independent data in the form of cosmic microwave background anisotropies, type Ia supernovae, cluster gas mass fractions, baryon acoustic oscillations, galaxy redshift surveys and cosmic shear. The combination of our data with current microwave background, supernova, gas mass fraction and baryon acoustic oscillation data yields $\Omega$m = 0.27 +/- 0.02,$\sigma$8 = 0.79 +/- 0.03 and w = -0.96 +/- 0.06 for flat, constant w models. The combined data also allow us to investigate evolving w models. Marginalizing over transition redshifts in the range 0.05-1, we constrain the equation of state at late and early times to be respectively w0 = -0.88 +/- 0.21 and wet = -1.05+0.20-0.36, again including conservative systematic allowances. The combined data provide constraints equivalent to a Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit of 15.5. Our results highlight the power of X-ray studies, which enable the straightforward production of large, complete and pure cluster samples and admit tight scaling relations, to constrain cosmology. However, the new statistical framework we apply to this task is equally applicable to cluster studies at other wavelengths.},

abstract = {The South Pole Telescope (SPT) is a 10 m diameter, wide-field, offset Gregorian telescope with a 966 pixel, multicolor, millimeter-wave, bolometer camera. It is located at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole station in Antarctica. The design of the SPT emphasizes careful control of spillover and scattering, to minimize noise and false signals due to ground pickup. The key initial project is a large-area survey at wavelengths of 3, 2, and 1.3 mm, to detect clusters of galaxies via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and to measure the small-scale angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The data will be used to characterize the primordial matter power spectrum and to place constraints on the equation of state of dark energy. A second-generation camera will measure the polarization of the CMB, potentially leading to constraints on the neutrino mass and the energy scale of inflation.},

abstract = {We have obtained spectra with the 10 m Keck telescope of a sample of 24 galaxies having colors consistent with star-forming galaxies at redshifts 2 {\textless}{\~{}} z {\textless}{\~{}} 4.5 in the Hubble deep field (HDF). Eleven of these galaxies are confirmed to be at high redshift (zmed = 3.0), one is at z = 0.5, and the other 12 have uncertain redshifts but have spectra consistent with their being at z {\textgreater} 2. The spectra of the confirmed high-redshift galaxies show a diversity of features, including weak Ly alpha emission, strong Ly alpha breaks or damped Ly alpha absorption profiles, and the stellar and interstellar rest-UV absorption lines common to local starburst galaxies and high-redshift star-forming galaxies reported recently by others. The narrow profiles and low equivalent widths of C IV, Si IV, and N V absorption lines may imply low stellar metallicities. Combined with the five high-redshift galaxies in the HDF previously confirmed with Keck spectra by Steidel et al. (1996a), the 16 confirmed sources yield a comoving volume density of n {\textgreater}= 2.4 x 10-4 h350 Mpc-3 for q0 = 0.05, or n {\textgreater}= 1.1 x 10-3 h350 Mpc-3 for q0 = 0.5. These densities are 3--4 times higher than the recent estimates of Steidel et al. (1996b) based on ground-based photometry with slightly brighter limits and are comparable to estimates of the local volume density of galaxies brighter than L*. The high-redshift density measurement is only a lower limit and could be almost 3 times higher still if all 29 of the unconfirmed candidates in our original sample, including those not observed, are indeed also at high redshift. The galaxies are small but luminous, with half-light radii 1.8 {\textless} r1/2 {\textless} 6.5 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}50 kpc and absolute magnitudes -21.5 {\textgreater} MB {\textgreater} -23. The HST images show a wide range of morphologies, including several with very close, small knots of emission embedded in wispy extended structures. Using rest-frame UV continuum fluxes with no dust correction, we calculate star formation rates in the range 7--24 or 3--9 h{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}50 Msolar yr-1 for q0 = 0.05 and q0 = 0.5, respectively. These rates overlap those for local spiral and H II galaxies today, although they could be more than twice as high if dust extinction in the UV is significant. If the objects at z = 3 were simply to fade by 5 mag (assuming a 107 yr burst and passive evolution) without mergers in the 14 Gyr between then and now (for q0 = 0.05, h50 = 1.0), they would resemble average dwarf elliptical/spheroidal galaxies in both luminosity and size. However, the variety of morphologies and the high number density of z = 3 galaxies in the HDF suggest that they represent a range of physical processes and stages of galaxy formation and evolution, rather than any one class of object, such as massive ellipticals. A key issue remains the measurement of masses. These high-redshift objects are likely to be the low-mass, starbursting building blocks of more massive galaxies seen today.},

abstract = {Galaxies that fall into clusters as a part of the same infall halo can retain correlations due to their shared origin. N-body simulations are used to study properties of such galaxy subgroups within clusters, including their richnesses and prevalence. The sizes, densities and velocity dispersions of all subgroups with ≥8 galaxies are found and compared to those of the host clusters. The largest galaxy subgroup provides a preferred direction in the cluster and is compared to other preferred directions in the cluster. Scatter in cluster mass measurements (via five observables), along ˜96 lines of sight, is compared to the relation of the line of sight to this preferred direction: scatter in cluster velocity dispersion measurements show the strongest correlation. The Dressler-Shectman test is an observational method to detect cluster substructure. This test is applied to the cluster sample to see whether the substructure it identifies is related to these subgroups. The results for any specific line of sight seem noisy; however, clusters with large subgroups tend to have a higher fraction of lines of sight where the test detects substructure.},

abstract = {TFIT is a software package for measuring relative galaxy photometry between imaging data sets with different angular resolutions, such as the Hubble ACS and Spitzer IRAC images taken for the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS). It combines prior information about spatial position and morphology obtained from high angular resolution images with PSF information about both images to construct object templates, which it then fits to a lower-resolution image of the same field. Simulations demonstrate that this technique improves accuracy in uncrowded fields, with performance holding steady as crowding increases and object separation decreases to 1.5 PSF FWHM: outperforming SExtractor by a factor of two. Photometry is also measured, with {\textless} 10{\%} degradation, for objects that SExtractor fails to deblend. On real GOODS data, TFIT produces results that are consistent with a traditional PSF subtraction method. TFIT is implemented in Python and C++.},

There are 269 spiral, 100 elliptical, 114 chain, 126 double-clump, 97 tadpole, and 178 clump-cluster galaxies. We also cataloged 30 B-band and 13 V-band dropouts and calculated their star formation rates. Chains, doubles, and tadpoles dominate the other types at faint magnitudes. The fraction of obvious bars among spirals is {\~{}}10{\%}, a factor of 2-3 lower than in other deep surveys. The distribution function of axial ratios for elliptical galaxies is similar to that seen locally, suggesting that ellipticals relaxed quickly to a standardized shape. The distribution of axial ratios for spiral galaxies is significantly different than locally, having a clear peak at {\~{}}0.55 instead of a nearly flat distribution. The falloff at small axial ratio occurs at a higher value than locally, indicating thicker disks by a factor of {\~{}}2. The falloff at high axial ratio could be from intrinsic triaxial shapes or selection effects. Inclined disks should be more highly sampled than face-on disks near the surface brightness limit of a survey. Simple models and data distributions demonstrate these effects. The decreased numbers of obvious spiral galaxies at high redshifts could be partly the result of surface brightness selection.},

Compared to our previously released catalogs, we make several improvements to the photometry, including smaller apertures, ICL subtraction, PSF matching, and empirically measured uncertainties. We further improve the Bayesian Photometric Redshift (BPZ) estimates by adding a redder elliptical template and by inflating the photometric uncertainties of the brightest galaxies. The resulting photometric redshift accuracies are dz/(1+z) {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 0.8$\backslash${\%}, 1.0$\backslash${\%}, and 2.0$\backslash${\%} for galaxies with I-band F814W AB magnitudes {\$}{\textless}{\$} 18, 20, and 23, respectively.

Our new catalog includes 1257 spectroscopic redshifts, including 382 confirmed cluster members. We also provide stellar mass estimates. Finally, we include lensing magnification estimates of background galaxies based on our public lens models. Our new catalog of all 25 CLASH clusters is available via MAST.

We determine the UV-continuum slope $\beta$ in these galaxies, and compare the slopes with galaxies at later times to measure the evolution in $\beta$. For luminous L* z=3 galaxies, we measure a mean UV-continuum slope $\beta$ of -2.0 ± 0.2, which is comparable to the $\beta$ {\~{}} -2 derived at similar luminosities at z {\~{}} 5-6. However, for the lower luminosity 0.1L* z=3 galaxies, we measure a mean $\beta$ of -3.0 ± 0.2. This is substantially bluer than is found for similar luminosity galaxies at z {\~{}} 4, just 800 Myr later, and even at z {\~{}} 5-6. In principle, the observed $\beta$ of -3.0 can be matched by a very young, dust-free stellar population, but when nebular emission is included the expected $\beta$ becomes {\textgreater}=-2.7. To produce these very blue $\beta$s (i.e., $\beta$ {\~{}} -3), extremely low metallicities and mechanisms to reduce the red nebular emission seem to be required. For example, a large escape fraction (i.e., f esc gsim 0.3) could minimize the contribution from this red nebular emission.

abstract = {We present a new approach for quantifying the abundance of galaxy clusters and constraining cosmological parameters using dynamical measurements. In the standard method, galaxy line-of-sight (LOS) velocities, {\$}v{\$}, or velocity dispersions are used to infer cluster masses, {\$}M{\$}, in order to quantify the halo mass function (HMF), {\$}dn(M)/d\backslashlog(M){\$}, which is strongly affected by mass measurement errors. In our new method, the probability distribution of velocities for each cluster in the sample are summed to create a new statistic called the velocity distribution function (VDF), {\$}dn(v)/dv{\$}. The VDF can be measured more directly and precisely than the HMF and it can also be robustly predicted with cosmological simulations which capture the dynamics of subhalos or galaxies. We apply these two methods to mock cluster catalogs and forecast the bias and constraints on the matter density parameter {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}m{\$} and the amplitude of matter fluctuations {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8{\$} in flat {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM cosmologies. For an example observation of 200 massive clusters, the VDF with (without) velocity errors constrains the parameter combination {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8\backslashOmega{\_}m{\^{}}{\{}0.29\backslash (0.29){\}} = 0.587 \backslashpm 0.011\backslash (0.583 \backslashpm 0.011){\$} and shows only minor bias. However, the HMF with dynamical mass errors is biased to low {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}m{\$} and high {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8{\$} and the fiducial model lies well outside of the forecast constraints, prior to accounting for Eddington bias. When the VDF is combined with constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the degeneracy between cosmological parameters can be significantly reduced. Upcoming spectroscopic surveys that probe larger volumes and fainter magnitudes will provide a larger number of clusters for applying the VDF as a cosmological probe.},

abstract = {We review our current understanding of how the first galaxies formed at the end of the cosmic dark ages, a few 100 million years after the Big Bang. Modern large telescopes discovered galaxies at redshifts greater than seven, whereas theoretical studies have just reached the degree of sophistication necessary to make meaningful predictions. A crucial ingredient is the feedback exerted by the first generation of stars, through UV radiation, supernova blast waves, and chemical enrichment. The key goal is to derive the signature of the first galaxies to be observed with upcoming or planned next-generation facilities, such as the James Webb Space Telescope or Atacama Large Millimeter Array. From the observational side, ongoing deep-field searches for very high-redshift galaxies begin to provide us with empirical constraints on the nature of the first galaxies.},

abstract = {We examine systematic differences in the derived X-ray properties of galaxy clusters as reported by three different groups: Vikhlinin et al. (2009a), Mantz et al. (2010b), and Planck Collaboration (2011b). The sample overlap between any two pairs of works ranges between 16 to 28 galaxy clusters in common. We find systematic differences in most reported properties, including the total cluster mass, M500. The most extreme case is an average 45{\%} $\backslash$pm 5{\%} difference in cluster mass between the Planck Collaboration (2011b) and Mantz et al. (2010b), for clusters at z {\textgreater} 0.13 (averaged over 16 clusters). These mass differences induce differences in cluster observables defined within an R500 aperture. After accounting for aperture differences, we find very good agreement in gas mass estimates between the different groups. However, the soft-band X-ray luminosity, LX, core-excised spectroscopic temperature, TX, and gas thermal energy, YX = MgasTX display mean differences at the 5{\%}-15{\%} level. We also find that the low (z $\backslash$leq 0.13) and high (z $\backslash$geq 0.13) galaxy cluster samples in Planck Collaboration (2011b) appear to be systematically different: the YSZ/YX ratio for these two sub- samples is ln(YSZ/YX) = -0.06 $\backslash$pm 0.04 and ln(YSZ/YX) = 0.08 $\backslash$pm 0.04 for the low and high redshift sub-samples respectively.},

abstract = {We study the formation of galaxies in a large volume (50h-1Mpc, 2 × 2883 particles) cosmological simulation, evolved using the entropy and energy-conserving smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET-2. Most of the baryonic mass in galaxies of all masses is originally acquired through filamentary `cold mode' accretion of gas that was never shock heated to its halo virial temperature, confirming the key feature of our earlier results obtained with a different SPH code. Atmospheres of hot, virialized gas develop in haloes above 2-3 × 1011 Msolar, a transition mass that is nearly constant from z = 3 to 0. Cold accretion persists in haloes above the transition mass, especially at z {\textgreater}= 2. It dominates the growth of galaxies in low-mass haloes at all times, and it is the main driver of the cosmic star formation history. Our results suggest that the cooling of shock-heated virialized gas, which has been the focus of many analytic models of galaxy growth spanning more than three decades, might be a relatively minor element of galaxy formation. At high redshifts, satellite galaxies have gas accretion rates similar to central galaxies of the same baryonic mass, but at z {\textless} 1 the accretion rates of low-mass satellites are well below those of comparable central galaxies. Relative to our earlier simulations, the GADGET-2 simulations predict much lower rates of `hot mode' accretion from the virialized gas component. Hot accretion rates compete with cold accretion rates near the transition mass, but only at z {\textless}= 1. Hot accretion is inefficient in haloes above {\~{}}5 × 1012 Msolar, with typical rates lower than 1Msolar yr-1 at z {\textless}= 1, even though our simulation does not include active galactic nuclei (AGN) heating or other forms of `preventive' feedback. Instead, the accretion rates are low because the inner density profiles of hot gas in these haloes are shallow, with long associated cooling times. The cooling recipes typically used in semi-analytic models can overestimate the accretion rates in these haloes by orders of magnitude, so these models may overemphasize the role of preventive feedback in producing observed galaxy masses and colours. A fraction of the massive haloes develop cuspy profiles and significant cooling rates between z = 1 and 0, a redshift trend similar to the observed trend in the frequency of cooling flow clusters.},

abstract = {We analyse the first cosmological simulations that recover the fragmentation of high-redshift galactic discs driven by cold streams. The fragmentation is recovered owing to an AMR resolution better than 70pc with cooling below 104K. We study three typical star-forming galaxies in haloes of {\~{}}5 × 1011Msolar at z {\~{}}= 2.3 when they were not undergoing a major merger. The steady gas supply by cold streams leads to gravitationally unstable, turbulent discs, which fragment into giant clumps and transient features on a dynamical time-scale. The disc clumps are not associated with dark-matter haloes. The clumpy discs are self-regulated by gravity in a marginally unstable state. Clump migration and angular-momentum transfer on an orbital time-scale help the growth of a central bulge with a mass comparable to the disc. The continuous gas input keeps the system of clumpy disc and bulge in a near steady state for several Gyr. The average star formation rate, much of which occurs in the clumps, follows the gas accretion rate of {\~{}}45Msolaryr-1. The simulated galaxies resemble in many ways the observed star-forming galaxies at high redshift. Their properties are consistent with the simple theoretical framework presented in Dekel, Sari {\&} Ceverino. In particular, a two-component analysis reveals that the simulated discs are indeed marginally unstable, and the time evolution confirms the robustness of the clumpy configuration in a cosmological steady state. By z {\~{}} 1, the simulated systems are stabilized by a dominant stellar spheroid, demonstrating the process of `morphological quenching' of star formation. We demonstrate that the disc fragmentation is not a numerical artefact once the Jeans length is kept larger than nearly seven resolution elements, i.e. beyond the standard Truelove criterion.},

abstract = {We simulate the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes by implementing a suite of semi-analytic models on the output of the Millennium Run, a very large simulation of the concordance $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmogony. Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.},

abstract = {One way to sample from a distribution is to sample uniformly from the region under the plot of its density function. A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal `slice' defined by the current vertical position. Variations on such `slice sampling' methods can easily be implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling, and may be more efficient than easily-constructed versions of the Metropolis algorithm. Slice sampling is therefore attractive in routine Markov chain Monte Carlo applications, and for use by software that automatically generates a Markov chain sampler from a model specification. One can also easily devise overrelaxed versions of slice sampling, which sometimes greatly improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walk behaviour. Random walks can also be avoided in some slice sampling schemes that simultaneously update all variables.},

For the first time, we properly take into account the dependence on redshift and cosmology of the quantities related to cluster physics: the critical density contrast, the growth factor, the mass conversion factor, the virial overdensity, the virial radius and, most importantly, the cluster number count derived from the observational temperature data. We show that, contrary to previous analyses, cluster data alone prefer low values of the amplitude of mass fluctuations, {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8 \backslashleq 0.69 (1\backslashsigma C.L.){\$}, and large amounts of nonrelativistic matter, {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}m \backslashgeq 0.38 (1\backslashsigma C.L.){\$}, in slight tension with the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM concordance cosmological model, though the results are compatible with {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM at {\$}2\backslashsigma{\$}.

abstract = {Using the complete Galaxy and Mass Assembly I (GAMA-I) survey covering ˜142 deg2 to rAB= 19.4, of which ˜47 deg2 is to rAB= 19.8, we create the GAMA-I galaxy group catalogue (G3Cv1), generated using a friends-of-friends (FoF) based grouping algorithm. Our algorithm has been tested extensively on one family of mock GAMA lightcones, constructed from $\Lambda$ cold dark matter N-body simulations populated with semi-analytic galaxies. Recovered group properties are robust to the effects of interlopers and are median unbiased in the most important respects. G3Cv1 contains 14 388 galaxy groups (with multiplicity ≥2), including 44 186 galaxies out of a possible 110 192 galaxies, implying ˜40 per cent of all galaxies are assigned to a group. The similarities of the mock group catalogues and G3Cv1 are multiple: global characteristics are in general well recovered. However, we do find a noticeable deficit in the number of high multiplicity groups in GAMA compared to the mocks. Additionally, despite exceptionally good local spatial completeness, G3Cv1 contains significantly fewer compact groups with five or more members, this effect becoming most evident for high multiplicity systems. These two differences are most likely due to limitations in the physics included of the current GAMA lightcone mock. Further studies using a variety of galaxy formation models are required to confirm their exact origin. The G3Cv1 catalogue will be made publicly available as and when the relevant GAMA redshifts are made available at .},

The observations, carried out with the Calar Alto 3.5m telescope using the wide field (0.25 sq. deg FOV) optical camera LAICA and the NIR instrument Omega-2000, correspond to {\~{}}700hrs on-target science images. The photometric system was designed to maximize the effective depth of the survey in terms of accurate spectral-type and photo-zs estimation along with the capability of identification of relatively faint emission lines. Here we present multicolor photometry and photo-zs for {\~{}}438k galaxies, detected in synthetic F814W images, complete down to I{\~{}}24.5 AB, taking into account realistic noise estimates, and correcting by PSF and aperture effects with the ColorPro software. The photometric ZP have been calibrated using stellar transformation equations and refined internally, using a new technique based on the highly robust photometric redshifts measured for emission line galaxies. We calculate photometric redshifts with the BPZ2 code, which includes new empirically calibrated templates and priors. Our photo-zs have a precision of {\$}dz/(1+z{\_}s)=1{\%}{\$} for I{\textless}22.5 and 1.4{\%} for 22.5{\textless}I{\textless}24.5. Precisions of less than 0.5{\%} are reached for the brighter spectroscopic sample, showing the potential of medium-band photometric surveys.

abstract = {The systematic errors in the virial mass-to-light ratio, Mv/L, of galaxy clusters as an estimator of the field M/L value are assessed. We overlay 14 clusters in redshift space to create an ensemble cluster that averages over substructure and asymmetries. The combined sample, including background, contains about 1150 galaxies, extending to a projected radius of about twice r200. The radius r200, defined as where the mean interior density is 200 times the critical density, is expected to contain the bulk of the virialized cluster mass. The dynamically derived M(r200)/L(r200) of the ensemble is (0.82 +/- 0.14){\textless}Mv/L{\textgreater}. The Mv/L overestimate is attributed to not taking into account the surface pressure term in the virial equation. Under the assumption that the velocity anisotropy parameter is in the range 0 {\textless}= beta {\textless}= $\backslash$frac {\{}2{\}}{\{}3{\}} , the galaxy distribution accurately traces the mass profile beyond about the central 0.3r200. There are no color or luminosity gradients in the galaxy population beyond 2r200, but there is 0.11 +/- 0.05 mag fading in the r-band luminosities between the field and cluster galaxies. We correct the cluster virial mass-to-light ratio, Mv/L = 289 +/- 50 h M⊙/L⊙ (calculated assuming q0 = 0.1), for the biases in Mv and mean luminosity to estimate the field M/L = 213 +/- 59 h M⊙/L⊙. With our self-consistently derived field luminosity density, j/ rho c = 1136 +/- 138 h M⊙/L⊙ (at z {\~{}}= $\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}}{\{}3{\}} ), the corrected M/L indicates Omega 0 = 0.19 +/- 0.06 +/- 0.04 (formal 1 sigma random error and estimated potential systematic errors) for those components of the mass field in rich clusters.},

abstract = {Using deep NIR VLT ISAAC and optical HST WFPC2 imaging in the HDF-S and MS 1054-03, we study the rest-frame UV-to-optical colors and magnitudes of galaxies to z{\~{}}3. Unlike the present day, there is no evidence for a red sequence at z{\~{}}3, but there does appear to be a well-defined CMR for blue galaxies at all redshifts, with more luminous galaxies having redder U-V colors. The slope of the blue CMR is independent of redshift $\delta$(U-V)/$\delta$MV=-0.09+/-0.01 and can be explained by a correlation of dust reddening with luminosity. The average color at fixed luminosity reddens strongly $\Delta$(U-V){\~{}}0.75 from z{\~{}}3 to z=0, much of which can be attributed to aging of stars. The color scatter of the blue sequence is relatively small $\sigma$(U-V)=0.25+/-0.03 and constant to z{\~{}}3, but notably asymmetrical, having a sharp blue ridge and a wing toward redder colors. We explore sets of SFHs to study the constraints placed by the shape of the scatter at z=2-3. One particular set of models, episodic star formation, reproduces the detailed properties very well. For a two-state model with high and low star formation, the duty cycle is constrained to be {\textgreater}40{\%} and the contrast in SFR between the states must be a factor {\textgreater}5 [or a scatter in log(SFR) of {\textgreater}0.35 dex around the mean]. Nevertheless, episodic models do not explain the observed tail of very red galaxies, primarily DRGs, which may have ceased star formation altogether or are more heavily obscured. Finally, the relative number density of red, luminous MV{\textless}-20.5 galaxies increases by a factor of {\~{}}6 from z=2.7 to 0.5, as does their contribution to the total rest-frame V-band luminosity density. We are likely viewing the progressive formation of red, passively evolving galaxies.

abstract = {Torques acting on galaxies lead to physical alignments, but the resulting ellipticity correlations are difficult to predict. As they constitute a major contaminant for cosmic shear studies, it is important to constrain the intrinsic alignment signal observationally. We measured the alignments of satellite galaxies within 90 massive galaxy clusters in the redshift range 0.05 {\textless}z{\textless} 0.55 and quantified their impact on the cosmic shear signal. We combined a sample of 38 104 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts with high-quality data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We used phase-space information to select 14 576 cluster members, 14 250 of which have shape measurements and measured three different types of alignment: the radial alignment of satellite galaxies toward the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), the common orientations of satellite galaxies and BCGs, and the radial alignments of satellites with each other. Residual systematic effects are much smaller than the statistical uncertainties. We detect no galaxy alignment of any kind out to at least 3r200. The signal is consistent with zero for both blue and red galaxies, bright and faint ones, and also for subsamples of clusters based on redshift, dynamical mass, and dynamical state. These conclusions are unchanged if we expand the sample with bright cluster members from the red sequence. We augment our constraints with those from the literature to estimate the importance of the intrinsic alignments of satellites compared to those of central galaxies, for which the alignments are described by the linear alignment model. Comparison of the alignment signals to the expected uncertainties of current surveys such as the Kilo-Degree Survey suggests that the linear alignment model is an adequate treatment of intrinsic alignments, but it is not clear whether this will be the case for larger surveys.

abstract = {We discuss the angular clustering of galaxy clusters at z {\textgreater} 1 selected within 50 sq. deg from the Spitzer Wide-Infrared Extragalactic survey. We employ a simple color selection to identify high redshift galaxies with no dependence on galaxy rest-frame optical color using Spitzer IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 micron photometry. The majority ({\textgreater}90{\%}) of galaxies with z {\textgreater} 1.3 are identified with [3.6] - [4.5] {\textgreater} -0.1 AB mag. We identify candidate galaxy clusters at z {\textgreater} 1 by selecting overdensities of {\textgreater}26-28 objects with [3.6] - [4.5] {\textgreater} -0.1 mag within radii of 1.4 arcminutes, which corresponds to r {\textless} 0.5 Mpc/h at z=1.5. These candidate galaxy clusters show strong angular clustering, with an angular correlation function represented by w(theta) = (3.1 +/- 0.5) theta{\^{}}(-1.1 +/- 0.1) with theta in units of arcminutes over scales of 2-100 arcminutes. Assuming the redshift distribution of these galaxy clusters follows a fiducial model, these galaxy clusters have a spatial-clustering scale length r{\_}0 = 22.4 +/- 3.6 Mpc/h, and a comoving number density n = 1.2 +/- 0.1 x 10{\^{}}-6 (Mpc/h){\^{}}-3. The correlation scale length and number density of these objects are comparable to those of rich galaxy clusters at low redshift. The number density of these high-redshift clusters correspond to dark-matter halos larger than 3-5 x 10{\^{}}13 h{\^{}}-1 solar masses at z=1.5. Assuming the dark halos hosting these high-redshift clusters grow following Lambda-CDM models, these clusters will reside in halos larger than 1-2 x 10{\^{}}14 h{\^{}}-1 solar masses at z=0.2, comparable to rich galaxy clusters.},

abstract = {We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to construct a sample of 625 brightest group and cluster galaxies (BCGs) together with control samples of non-BCGs matched in stellar mass, redshift and colour. We investigate how the systematic properties of BCGs depend on stellar mass and on their privileged location near the cluster centre. The groups and clusters that we study are drawn from the C4 catalogue of Miller et al. but we have developed improved algorithms for identifying the BCG and for measuring the cluster velocity dispersion. Since the SDSS photometric pipeline tends to underestimate the luminosities of large galaxies in dense environments, we have developed a correction for this effect which can be readily applied to the published catalogue data. We find that BCGs are larger and have higher velocity dispersions than non-BCGs of the same stellar mass, which implies that BCGs contain a larger fraction of dark matter. In contrast to non-BCGs, the dynamical mass-to-light ratio of BCGs does not vary as a function of galaxy luminosity. Hence BCGs lie on a different Fundamental Plane than ordinary elliptical galaxies. BCGs also follow a steeper Faber-Jackson relation than non-BCGs, as suggested by models in which BCGs assemble via dissipationless mergers along preferentially radial orbits. We find tentative evidence that this steepening is stronger in more massive clusters. BCGs have similar mean stellar ages and metallicities to non-BCGs of the same mass, but they have somewhat higher $\alpha$/Fe ratios, indicating that star formation may have occurred over a shorter time-scale in the BCGs. Finally, we find that BCGs are more likely to host radio-loud active galactic nuclei than other galaxies of the same mass, but are less likely to host an optical active galactic nucleus (AGN). The differences we find are more pronounced for the less massive BCGs, i.e. they are stronger at the galaxy group level.},

abstract = {Using the South Pole Telescope (SPT), we have discovered the most massive known galaxy cluster at z {\textgreater} 1, SPT-CL J2106-5844. In addition to producing a strong Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect signal, this system is a luminous X-ray source and its numerous constituent galaxies display spatial and color clustering, all indicating the presence of a massive galaxy cluster. VLT and Magellan spectroscopy of 18 member galaxies shows that the cluster is at z = 1.132{\^{}}+0.002{\_}-0.003. Chandra observations obtained through a combined HRC-ACIS GTO program reveal an X-ray spectrum with an Fe K line redshifted by z = 1.18 +/- 0.03. These redshifts are consistent with galaxy colors in extensive optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared imaging. SPT-CL J2106-5844 displays extreme X-ray properties for a cluster, having a core-excluded temperature of kT = 11.0{\^{}}+2.6{\_}-1.9 keV and a luminosity (within r{\_}500) of L{\_}X (0.5 - 2.0 keV) = (13.9 +/- 1.0) x 10{\^{}}44 erg/s. The combined mass estimate from measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and X-ray data is M{\_}200 = (1.27 +/- 0.21) x 10{\^{}}15 M{\_}sun. The discovery of such a massive gravitationally collapsed system at high redshift provides an interesting laboratory for galaxy formation and evolution, and is a powerful probe of extreme perturbations of the primordial matter density field. We discuss the latter, determining that, under the assumption of LambdaCDM cosmology with only Gaussian perturbations, there is only a 7{\%} chance of finding a galaxy cluster similar to SPT-CL J2106-5844 in the 2500 deg{\^{}}2 SPT survey region, and that only one such galaxy cluster is expected in the entire sky.},

abstract = {The origin of color gradients in elliptical galaxies is examined by comparing model gradients with those observed in the Hubble Deep Field. The models are constructed so as to reproduce color gradients in local elliptical galaxies either by a metallicity gradient or by an age gradient. By looking-back a sequence of the color gradient as a function of redshift, the age-metallicity degeneracy is solved. The observed color gradients in elliptical galaxies at z=0.1 to 1.0 agree excellently with those predicted by the metallicity gradient, while they deviate significantly from those predicted by the age gradient even at z{\~{}}0.3, and the deviation becomes larger with increasing redshift. This result does not depend on cosmological parameters and parameters for an evolutionary model of an elliptical galaxy within a reasonable range. Thus our results clearly indicate that the origin of color gradients is not age but stellar metallicity.},

abstract = {We select 25,000 galaxies from the NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey (NMBS) to study the rest-frame U - V color distribution of galaxies at 0 {\textless} z lsim 2.5. The five unique NIR filters of the NMBS enable the precise measurement of photometric redshifts and rest-frame colors for 9900 galaxies at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5. The rest-frame U - V color distribution at all z lsim 2.5 is bimodal, with a red peak, a blue peak, and a population of galaxies in between (the green valley). Model fits to the optical-NIR spectral energy distributions and the distribution of MIPS-detected galaxies indicate that the colors of galaxies in the green valley are determined largely by the amount of reddening by dust. This result does not support the simplest interpretation of green valley objects as a transition from blue star forming to red quiescent galaxies. We show that correcting the rest-frame colors for dust reddening allows a remarkably clean separation between the red and blue sequences up to z {\~{}} 2.5. Our study confirms that dusty-starburst galaxies can contribute a significant fraction to red-sequence samples selected on the basis of a single rest-frame color (i.e., U - V), so extra care must be taken if samples of truly "red and dead" galaxies are desired. Interestingly, of galaxies detected at 24 $\mu$m, 14{\%} remain on the red sequence after applying the reddening correction.},

Observed static properties discussed are: richness, classification schemes, galactic content, cD galaxies, density profiles, sizes, and the optical luminosity function. Several characteristic time scales of clusters of galaxies are examined along with mass segregation, the dynamical evolution of clusters, cluster masses, mass-to-light ratios, the missing-mass problem, and the mean galactic and cluster mass densities in the universe. The main characteristics of clusters that contain X-ray emission are summarized, emphasizing the relation of the X-ray emission to optical properties.

In this paper, we present an investigation of the properties of galaxies in galaxy groups at intermediate redshift (z {\~{}} 0.4). The groups were selected from the CNOC2 redshift survey as described in Carlberg et al., 2001, with further spectroscopic follow-up undertaken at the Magellan telescope in order to improve the completeness and depth of the sample. We present the data for the individual groups, and find no clear trend in the fraction of passive galaxies with group velocity dispersion and group concentration. We stack the galaxy groups in order to compare the properties of group galaxies with those of field galaxies at the same redshift. The groups contain a larger fraction of passive galaxies than the field, this trend being particularly clear for galaxies brighter than M{\_}{\{}B{\_}J{\}} {\textless} -20 in the higher velocity dispersion groups. In addition, we see evidence for an excess of bright passive galaxies in the groups relative to the field. In contrast, the luminosity functions of the star forming galaxies in the groups and the field are consistent. These trends are qualitatively consitent with the differences between group and field galaxies seen in the local universe.},

Over the past two decades optical spectroscopy with large ground-based telescopes, and more recently ultraviolet spectroscopy from space have yielded a wealth of information on what appears to be a gaseous, photoionized intergalactic medium, partly enriched by the products of stellar nucleosynthesis, residing in coherent structures over many hundreds of kiloparsecs. Recent progress with cosmological hydro-simulations based on hierarchical structure formation models has led to important insights into the physical structures giving rise to the forest. If these ideas are correct, a truely inter- and proto-galactic medium [at high redshift (z {\~{}} 3), the main repository of baryons] collapses under the influence of dark matter gravity into flattened or filamentary structures, which are seen in absorption against background QSOs. With decreasing redshift, galaxies forming in the denser regions, may contribute an increasing part of the Lyman alpha absorption cross-section. Comparisons between large data samples from the new generation of telescopes and artificial Lyman alpha forest spectra from cosmological simulations promise to become a useful cosmological tool.},

abstract = {The large-scale structure of the Universe formed from initially small perturbations in the cosmic density field, leading to galaxy clusters with up to 1015 M⊙ at the present day. Here, we review the formation of structures in the Universe, considering the first primordial galaxies and the most massive galaxy clusters as extreme cases of structure formation where fundamental processes such as gravity, turbulence, cooling and feedback are particularly relevant. The first non-linear objects in the Universe formed in dark matter halos with 105-108 M⊙ at redshifts 10-30, leading to the first stars and massive black holes. At later stages, larger scales became non-linear, leading to the formation of galaxy clusters, the most massive objects in the Universe. We describe here their formation via gravitational processes, including the self-similar scaling relations, as well as the observed deviations from such self-similarity and the related non-gravitational physics (cooling, stellar feedback, AGN). While on intermediate cluster scales the self-similar model is in good agreement with the observations, deviations from such self-similarity are apparent in the core regions, where numerical simulations do not reproduce the current observational results. The latter indicates that the interaction of different feedback processes may not be correctly accounted for in current simulations. Both in the most massive clusters of galaxies as well as during the formation of the first objects in the Universe, turbulent structures and shock waves appear to be common, suggesting them to be ubiquitous in the non-linear regime.},

abstract = {We combine ultraviolet to near-infrared photometry with HI 21cm line observations for a complete volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies in different environments (from isolated galaxies to Virgo cluster members), to study the migration of spirals from the blue to the red sequence. Although our analysis confirms that, in the transition region between the two sequences, a high fraction of spirals host active galactic nuclei (AGN), it clearly shows that late types with quenched star formation are mainly HI deficient galaxies preferentially found in the Virgo cluster. This not only suggests that environmental effects could play a significant role in driving the migration of local galaxies from the blue sequence, but it also implies that a physical link between AGN feedback and quenching may not be assumed from a correlation between nuclear activity and colour.},

abstract = {We study the star formation rate (SFR)-stellar mass (M sstarf) relation in a self-consistent manner from 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 with 22,816 star-forming galaxies selected from the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey. We find a significant nonlinear slope of the relation, SFRvpropM 0.6 sstarf, and a constant observed scatter of 0.34 dex, independent of redshift and M sstarf. However, if we select only blue galaxies we find a linear relation SFRvpropM sstarf, similar to previous results at z = 0 by Peng et al. This selection excludes red, dusty, star-forming galaxies with higher masses, which brings down the slope. By selecting on L IR/L UV (a proxy for dust obscuration) and the rest-frame U - V colors, we show that star-forming galaxies fall in three distinct regions of the log(SFR)-log(M sstarf) plane: (1) actively star-forming galaxies with "normal" dust obscuration and associated colors (54{\%} for log (M sstarf) {\textgreater} 10 at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5), (2) red star-forming galaxies with low levels of dust obscuration and low-specific SFRs (11{\%}), and (3) dusty, blue star-forming galaxies with high-specific SFRs (7{\%}). The remaining 28{\%} comprises quiescent galaxies. Galaxies on the "normal" star formation sequence show strong trends of increasing dust attenuation with stellar mass and a decreasing specific SFR, with an observed scatter of 0.25 dex. The dusty, blue galaxies reside in the upper envelope of the star formation sequence with remarkably similar spectral shapes at all masses, suggesting that the same physical process is dominating the stellar light. The red, low-dust star-forming galaxies may be in the process of shutting off and migrating to the quiescent population.},

abstract = {The XMM Cluster Survey (XCS) is a serendipitous search for galaxy clusters using all publicly available data in the XMM-Newton Science Archive. Its main aims are to measure cosmological parameters and trace the evolution of X-ray scaling relations. In this paper we present the first data release from the XMM Cluster Survey (XCS-DR1). This consists of 503 optically confirmed, serendipitously detected, X-ray clusters. Of these clusters, 256 are new to the literature and 357 are new X-ray discoveries. We present 463 clusters with a redshift estimate (0.06 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.46), including 261 clusters with spectroscopic redshifts. The remainder have photometric redshifts. In addition, we have measured X-ray temperatures (TX) for 401 clusters (0.4 {\textless} TX {\textless} 14.7 keV). We highlight seven interesting subsamples of XCS-DR1 clusters: (i) 10 clusters at high redshift (z {\textgreater} 1.0, including a new spectroscopically confirmed cluster at z= 1.01); (ii) 66 clusters with high TX ({\textgreater}5 keV) (iii) 130 clusters/groups with low TX ({\textless}2 keV) (iv) 27 clusters with measured TX values in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) ‘Stripe 82' co-add region; (v) 77 clusters with measured TX values in the Dark Energy Survey region; (vi) 40 clusters detected with sufficient counts to permit mass measurements (under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium); (vii) 104 clusters that can be used for applications such as the derivation of cosmological parameters and the measurement of cluster scaling relations. The X-ray analysis methodology used to construct and analyse the XCS-DR1 cluster sample has been presented in a companion paper, Lloyd-Davies et al.},

abstract = {Aims: We study the stellar mass content of massive haloes in the redshift range 0.86 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.34, by measuring (1) the stellar mass in the central galaxy versus total dynamical halo mass; (2) the total stellar mass (including satellites) versus total halo mass; and (3) the radial stellar mass and number density profiles for the ensemble halo. Methods: We use a Ks-band selected catalogue for the 10 clusters in the Gemini Cluster Astrophysics Spectroscopic Survey (GCLASS), with photometric redshifts and stellar masses measured from 11-band SED fitting. Combining the photometric catalogues with the deep spectroscopic component of GCLASS, we correct the cluster galaxy sample for interlopers. We also perform a dynamical analysis of the cluster galaxies to estimate the halo mass M200 for each cluster based on a measurement of its velocity dispersion. Results: (1) We find that the central galaxy stellar mass fraction decreases with total halo mass and that this is in reasonable, quantitative agreement with measurements from abundance matching studies at z {\~{}} 1. (2) The total stellar mass fractions of these systems decrease with halo mass, indicating that lower mass systems are more efficient at transforming baryons into stars. We find the total stellar mass to be a good proxy for total halo mass, with a small intrinsic scatter. When we compare these results from GCLASS with literature measurements, we find that the stellar mass fraction at fixed halo mass shows no significant evolution in the range 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1. (3) We measure a relatively high NFW concentration parameter cg {\~{}} 7 for the stellar mass distribution in these clusters, and debate a possible scenario for explaining the evolution of the stellar mass distribution from the GCLASS sample to their likely descendants at lower redshift. Conclusions: The stellar mass measurements in the z {\~{}} 1 haloes provided by GCLASS puts constraints on the stellar mass assembly history of clusters observed in the local Universe. A simple model shows that the stellar mass content of GCLASS can evolve in typical distributions observed at lower redshifts if the clusters primarily accrete stellar mass onto the outskirts.},

In this primarily pedagogical contribution, we give a brief overview of the most basic MCMC method and some practical advice for the use of MCMC in real inference problems. We give advice on method choice, tuning for performance, methods for initialization, tests of convergence, troubleshooting, and use of the chain output to produce or report parameter estimates with associated uncertainties. We argue that autocorrelation time is the most important test for convergence, as it directly connects to the uncertainty on the sampling estimate of any quantity of interest. We emphasize that sampling is a method for doing integrals; this guides our thinking about how MCMC output is best used.},

The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4+-0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well. Both descriptions provide potentially useful "recipes" for modelling the SFR in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

abstract = {We provide new constraints on the connection between galaxies in the local universe, identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and dark matter halos and their constituent substructures in the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model using WMAP7 cosmological parameters. Predictions for the abundance and clustering properties of dark matter halos, and the relationship between dark matter hosts and substructures, are based on a high-resolution cosmological simulation, the Bolshoi simulation. We associate galaxies with halos and subhalos using subhalo abundance matching, performing a comprehensive analysis which investigates the underlying assumptions of this technique including (a) which halo property is most closely associated with galaxy stellar masses and luminosities, (b) how much scatter is in this relationship, and (c) how much subhalos can be stripped before their galaxies are destroyed. The models are jointly constrained by new measurements of the projected two-point galaxy clustering and the observed conditional stellar mass function of galaxies in groups. The data put tight constraints on the satellite fraction of galaxies as a function of galaxy stellar mass, on the scatter between halo and galaxy properties, and on the underlying conditional stellar mass function. These data rule out several halo properties commonly used in abundance matching, largely because the satellite fractions in the models disagree with those data. We show that an abundance matching model that associates galaxies with the peak circular velocity of their halos is in good agreement with the data, when scatter of {\$}0.20 \backslashpm 0.03{\$} dex in stellar mass at a given peak velocity is included. This will yield important constraints for galaxy formation models, and also provides encouraging indications that the galaxy--halo connection can be modeled with sufficient fidelity for future precision studies of the dark Universe.},

The results suggest that reionization is less an event than a process, with the process beginning as early as {\$}z \backslashsim 14{\$}, and with the 'percolation', or 'overlap' phase ending at {\$}z \backslashsim 6{\$}. The data are consistent with low luminosity star forming galaxies as being the dominant sources of reionizing photons. Low frequency radio telescopes currently under construction should be able to make the first direct measurements of HI 21cm emission from the neutral IGM during the EoR, and upcoming measurements of secondary CMB temperature anisotropy will provide fine details of the dynamics of the reionized IGM.},

We model the Chandra data from the core to the virial radius and show that the steep temperature profile is not compatible with hydrostatic equilibrium of the hot gas, and that the gas is convectively unstable at the outskirts. A possible interpretation of the Chandra data is the presence of a second phase of warm-hot gas near the cluster's virial radius that is not in hydrostatic equilibrium with the cluster's potential. The observations are also consistent with an alternative scenario in which the gas is significantly clumped at large radii.},

abstract = {We study the systematic bias introduced when selecting the spectroscopic redshifts of brighter cluster galaxies to estimate the velocity dispersion of galaxy clusters from both simulated and observational galaxy catalogues. We select clusters with Ngal ≥ 50 at five low-redshift snapshots from the publicly available De Lucia {\&} Blaziot semi-analytic model galaxy catalogue. Clusters are also selected from the Tempel Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8 groups and clusters catalogue across the redshift range 0.021 ≤ z ≤ 0.098. We employ various selection techniques to explore whether the velocity dispersion bias is simply due to a lack of dynamical information or is the result of an underlying physical process occurring in the cluster, for example, dynamical friction experienced by the brighter cluster members. The velocity dispersions of the parent dark matter (DM) haloes are compared to the galaxy cluster dispersions and the stacked distribution of DM particle velocities is examined alongside the corresponding galaxy velocity distribution. We find a clear bias between the halo and the semi-analytic galaxy cluster velocity dispersion on the order of $\sigma$gal/$\sigma$DM ˜ 0.87-0.95 and a distinct difference in the stacked galaxy and DM particle velocities distribution. We identify a systematic underestimation of the velocity dispersions when imposing increasing absolute I-band magnitude limits. This underestimation is enhanced when using only the brighter cluster members for dynamical analysis on the order of 5-35 per cent, indicating that dynamical friction is a serious source of bias when using galaxy velocities as tracers of the underlying gravitational potential. In contrast to the literature we find that the resulting bias is not only halo mass dependent but also that the nature of the dependence changes according to the galaxy selection strategy. We make a recommendation that, in the realistic case of limited availability of spectral observations, a strictly magnitude-limited sample should be avoided to ensure an unbiased estimate of the velocity dispersion.},

abstract = {Using mass-selected galaxy samples from deep multiwavelength data we investigate the incidence of close galaxy pairs between z = 0.4 and 2. Many such close pairs will eventually merge, and the pair fraction is therefore related to the merger rate. Over this redshift range the mean pair fraction is essentially constant (evolving as f pair {\~{}} (1 + z)-0.4 ± 0.6) with about 6{\%} ± 1{\%} of massive galaxies having a 1: 4 or greater companion within 30 h -1 kpc. Assuming the timescale over which pairs merge is not a strong function of redshift, this implies a similarly constant merger rate (per unit time) out to z = 2. Since about three times as much cosmic time passes at z {\textless} 1 as between z = 1 and 2, this implies that correspondingly more mergers occur in the low-redshift universe. When minor companions (1:10 mass ratio or greater) are included, the pair fraction increases to {\~{}}20{\%} and still does not evolve strongly with redshift. We also use a rest-frame color criterion to select pairs containing only quiescent galaxies (major "dry merger" progenitors), and find them to be similarly rare and constant with 4{\%}-7{\%} of massive quiescent galaxies exhibiting a nearby companion. Thus, even though other studies find major mergers to be relatively uncommon since z = 1, our results suggest that few additional mergers occur in the 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2 range and other mechanisms may be required to explain the mass and size growth of galaxies over this epoch.},

abstract = {This paper is the first in a series in which we perform an extensive comparison of various galaxy-based cluster mass estimation techniques that utilize the positions, velocities and colours of galaxies. Our primary aim is to test the performance of these cluster mass estimation techniques on a diverse set of models that will increase in complexity. We begin by providing participating methods with data from a simple model that delivers idealized clusters, enabling us to quantify the underlying scatter intrinsic to these mass estimation techniques. The mock catalogue is based on a Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model that assumes spherical Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW) haloes truncated at R200, with no substructure nor colour segregation, and with isotropic, isothermal Maxwellian velocities. We find that, above 1014M⊙, recovered cluster masses are correlated with the true underlying cluster mass with an intrinsic scatter of typically a factor of 2. Below 1014M⊙, the scatter rises as the number of member galaxies drops and rapidly approaches an order of magnitude. We find that richness-based methods deliver the lowest scatter, but it is not clear whether such accuracy may simply be the result of using an over-simplistic model to populate the galaxies in their haloes. Even when given the true cluster membership, large scatter is observed for the majority non-richness-based approaches, suggesting that mass reconstruction with a low number of dynamical tracers is inherently problematic.},

@article{Schawinski2014,
abstract = {We use SDSS+$\backslash$textit{\{}GALEX{\}}+Galaxy Zoo data to study the quenching of star formation in low-redshift galaxies. We show that the green valley between the blue cloud of star-forming galaxies and the red sequence of quiescent galaxies in the colour-mass diagram is not a single transitional state through which most blue galaxies evolve into red galaxies. Rather, an analysis that takes morphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blue early-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologies are transformed from disk to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly. In contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant disks, and they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation rates decline very slowly. We summarize a range of observations that lead to these conclusions, including UV-optical colours and halo masses, which both show a striking dependence on morphological type. We interpret these results in terms of the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. We conclude that late-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply of gas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustion of the remaining gas over several Gyr, driven by secular and/or environmental processes. In contrast, early-type galaxies require a scenario where the gas supply and gas reservoir are destroyed virtually instantaneously, with rapid quenching accompanied by a morphological transformation from disk to spheroid. This gas reservoir destruction could be the consequence of a major merger, which in most cases transforms galaxies from disk to elliptical morphology, and mergers could play a role in inducing black hole accretion and possibly AGN feedback.},

abstract = {(Abriged) We present a study of the integrated physical properties of a sample of 28 X-ray galaxy clusters observed with Chandra at redshift between 0.4 and 1.3. In particular, we have twelve objects in the redshift range 0.4-0.6, five between 0.6 and 0.8, seven between 0.8 and 1 and four at z{\textgreater}1, compounding the largest sample available for such a study. We focus particularly on the properties and evolution of the X-ray scaling laws. We fit both a single and a double beta-model with the former which provides a good representation of the observed surface brightness profiles, indicating that these clusters do not show any significant excess in their central brightness. By using the best-fit parameters of the beta-model together with the measured emission-weighted temperature (in the range 3-11 keV), we recover gas luminosity, gas mass and total gravitating mass out to R500. We observe scaling relations steeper than expected from self-similar model by a significant ({\textgreater}3 sigma) amount in the L-T and Mgas-T relations. We detect hints of negative evolution in the L-T, Mgas-T and L-Mtot relations, thus suggesting that systems at higher redshift have lower X-ray luminosity and gas mass for fixed temperature. In particular, when the 16 clusters at z{\textgreater}0.6 are considered, the evolution becomes more evident and its power-law modelization is a statistically good description of the data.},

abstract = {The growth of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies are thought to be linked, but the precise nature of this symbiotic relationship is still poorly understood. Both observations and simulations of galaxy formation suggest that the energy input from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), as the central supermassive black hole accretes material and grows, heats the interstellar material and suppresses star formation. In this Letter, we show that most host galaxies of moderate-luminosity supermassive black holes in the local universe have intermediate optical colors that imply the host galaxies are transitioning from star formation to quiescence, the first time this has been shown to be true for all AGNs independent of obscuration. The intermediate colors suggest that star formation in the host galaxies ceased roughly 100 Myr ago. This result indicates that either the AGNs are very long lived, accreting for more than 1 Gyr beyond the end of star formation, or there is a {\~{}}100 Myr time delay between the shutdown of star formation and detectable black hole growth. The first explanation is unlikely given current estimates for AGN lifetimes, so low-luminosity AGNs must shut down star formation before substantial black hole accretion activity is detected. The scarcity of AGN host galaxies in the blue cloud reported here challenges scenarios where significant star formation and black hole growth are coeval. Lastly, these observations also strongly support the "Unified Model" of AGNs as the host galaxy colors are independent of obscuration toward the central engine.},

abstract = {A model of galaxy formation is developed in which dissipation plays a role along with purely gravitational processes. The gist of the model is that the distribution of the dominant mass component on all scales arises from purely gravitational clustering, while the observed sizes and luminosity functions of galaxies are determined by gas-dynamical dissipative processes. The model accounts for the large amount of nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80{\%} or more of the virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably well with observation.},

abstract = {We investigate the power of the caustic technique to identify substructures of galaxy clusters from optical redshift data alone. The caustic technique is designed to estimate the mass profile of galaxy clusters to radii well beyond the virial radius, where dynamical equilibrium does not hold. Two by-products of this technique are the identification of the cluster members and the identification of the cluster substructures. We test the caustic technique as a substructure detector on two samples of 150 mock redshift surveys of clusters; the clusters are extracted from a large cosmological {\$}N{\$}-body simulation of a {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model and have mass {\$}M{\_}{\{}200{\}} \backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}} h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} and {\$}M{\_}{\{}200{\}} \backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}15{\}} h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} in the two samples respectively.

These encouraging results show that the caustic technique is a promising approach to investigate the complex dynamics of galaxy clusters.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of detecting and characterizing local variability in time series and other forms of sequential data. The goal is to identify and characterize statistically significant variations, at the same time suppressing the inevitable corrupting observational errors. We present a simple nonparametric modeling technique and an algorithm implementing it—an improved and generalized version of Bayesian Blocks—that finds the optimal segmentation of the data in the observation interval. The structure of the algorithm allows it to be used in either a real-time trigger mode, or a retrospective mode. Maximum likelihood or marginal posterior functions to measure model fitness are presented for events, binned counts, and measurements at arbitrary times with known error distributions. Problems addressed include those connected with data gaps, variable exposure, extension to piecewise linear and piecewise exponential representations, multivariate time series data, analysis of variance, data on the circle, other data modes, and dispersed data. Simulations provide evidence that the detection efficiency for weak signals is close to a theoretical asymptotic limit derived by Arias-Castro et al. In the spirit of Reproducible Research all of the code and data necessary to reproduce all of the figures in this paper are included as supplementary material.},

abstract = {We present global structural parameter measurements of 109,533 unique, H{\_}F160W-selected objects from the CANDELS multi-cycle treasury program. Sersic model fits for these objects are produced with GALFIT in all available near-infrared filters (H{\_}F160W, J{\_}F125W and, for a subset, Y{\_}F105W). The parameters of the best-fitting Sersic models (total magnitude, half-light radius, Sersic index, axis ratio, and position angle) are made public, along with newly constructed point spread functions for each field and filter. Random uncertainties in the measured parameters are estimated for each individual object based on a comparison between multiple, independent measurements of the same set of objects. To quantify systematic uncertainties we create a mosaic with simulated galaxy images with a realistic distribution of input parameters and then process and analyze the mosaic in an identical manner as the real data. We find that accurate and precise measurements -- to 10{\%} or better -- of all structural parameters can typically be obtained for galaxies with H{\_}F160W {\textless} 23, with comparable fidelity for basic size and shape measurements for galaxies to H{\_}F160W {\~{}} 24.5.},

abstract = {Clumpy galaxies in the Galaxy Evolution from Morphology and SEDs and Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey fields are examined for clues to their evolution into modern spirals. The magnitudes of the clumps and the surface brightnesses of the interclump regions are measured and fitted to models of stellar age and mass. There is an evolutionary trend from clump clusters with no evident interclump emission to clump clusters with faint red disks, to spiral galaxies of the flocculent or grand design types. Along this sequence, the interclump surface density increases and the mass surface density contrast between the clumps and the interclump regions decreases, suggesting a gradual dispersal of clumps to form disks. Also along this sequence, the bulge-to-clump mass ratios and age ratios increase, suggesting a gradual formation of bulges. All of these morphological types occur in the same redshift range, indicating that the clump cluster morphology is not the result of bandshifting. This redshift range also includes clear examples of interacting galaxies with tidal tails and other characteristic features, indicating that clump clusters, which do not have these features, are not generally interacting. Comparisons to local galaxies with the same rest wavelength and spatial resolution show that clump clusters are unlike local flocculent and spiral galaxies primarily because of the high clump/interclump contrasts in the clump clusters. They bear a striking resemblance to local dwarf irregulars, however. This resemblance is consistent with a model in which the clumpy morphology comes from gravitational instabilities in gas with a high turbulent speed compared to the rotation speed and a high mass fraction compared to the stars. The morphology does not depend on galaxy mass as much as it depends on evolutionary stage: clump clusters are 100 times more massive than local dwarfs. The apparent lack of star formation in damped Lyman alpha absorbers may result from fast turbulence.},

abstract = {We report the spectroscopic confirmation of SPT-CL J0546-5345 at langzrang = 1.067. To date this is the most distant cluster to be spectroscopically confirmed from the 2008 South Pole Telescope (SPT) catalog, and indeed the first z{\textgreater}1 cluster discovered by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE). We identify 21 secure spectroscopic members within 0.9 Mpc of the SPT cluster position, 18 of which are quiescent, early-type galaxies. From these quiescent galaxies we obtain a velocity dispersion of 1179+232 -167 km s-1, ranking SPT-CL J0546-5345 as the most dynamically massive cluster yet discovered at z{\textgreater}1. Assuming that SPT-CL J0546-5345 is virialized, this implies a dynamical mass of M 200 = 1.0+0.6 -0.4 × 1015 M sun, in agreement with the X-ray and SZE mass measurements. Combining masses from several independent measures leads to a best-estimate mass of M 200 = (7.95 ± 0.92) × 1014 M sun. The spectroscopic confirmation of SPT-CL J0546-5345, discovered in the wide-angle, mass-selected SPT cluster survey, marks the onset of the high-redshift SZE-selected galaxy cluster era.},

abstract = {Measurements of galaxy cluster abundances, clustering properties, and mass-to-light ratios in current and future surveys can provide important cosmological constraints. Digital wide-field imaging surveys, the recently demonstrated fidelity of red-sequence cluster detection techniques, and a new generation of realistic mock galaxy surveys provide the means for construction of large, cosmologically interesting cluster samples, whose selection and properties can be understood in unprecedented depth. Here we present the details of the ``maxBCG'' algorithm, a cluster detection technique tailored to multiband CCD imaging data. MaxBCG primarily relies on an observational cornerstone of massive galaxy clusters: they are marked by an overdensity of bright, uniformly red galaxies. This detection scheme also exploits classical brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), which are often found at the centers of these same massive clusters. We study the algorithm through its performance on large, realistic, mock galaxy catalogs, which reveal that it is over 90{\%} pure for clusters at 0.1{\textless}z{\textless}0.3 with 10 or more red galaxies, and over 90{\%} complete for halos at 0.1{\textless}z{\textless}0.3 with masses above 2×1014 h-1 Msolar. MaxBCG is able to approximately recover the underlying halo abundance function and assign cluster richnesses strongly coupled to the underlying halo properties. The same tests indicate that maxBCG rarely fragments halos, occasionally overmerges line-of-sight neighboring ({\~{}}=10 h-1 Mpc) halos, and overestimates the intrinsic halo red-sequence galaxy population by no more than 20{\%}. The study concludes with a discussion of considerations for cosmological measurements with such catalogs, including modeling the selection function, the role of photometric errors, the possible cosmological dependence of richness measurements, and fair cluster selection across broad redshift ranges employing multiple bandpasses.},

abstract = {We present a study on spectral energy distributions, morphologies, and star formation for an IRAC-selected extremely red object sample in the GOODS Chandra Deep Field-South. This work was enabled by new HST/WFC3 near-IR imaging from the CANDELS survey as well as the deepest available X-ray data from Chandra 4 Ms observations. This sample consists of 133 objects with the 3.6 $\mu$m limiting magnitude of [3.6] = 21.5 and is approximately complete for galaxies with M * {\textgreater} 1011 M ⊙ at 1.5 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 2.5. We classify this sample into two types, quiescent and star-forming galaxies (SFGs), in the observed infrared color-color ([3.6]-[24] versus K - [3.6]) diagram. The further morphological study of this sample shows a consistent result with the observed color classification. The classified quiescent galaxies are bulge dominated and SFGs in the sample have disk or irregular morphologies. Our observed infrared color classification is also consistent with the rest-frame color (U - V versus V - J) classification. We also found that quiescent and SFGs are well separated in the nonparametric morphology parameter (Gini versus M 20) diagram measuring their concentration and clumpiness: quiescent galaxies have a Gini coefficient higher than 0.58 and SFGs have a Gini coefficient lower than 0.58. We argue that the star formation quenching process must lead to or be accompanied by the increasing galaxy concentration. One prominent morphological feature of this sample is that disks are commonly seen in this massive galaxy sample at 1.5 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 2.5: 30{\%} of quiescent galaxies and 70{\%} of SFGs with M * {\textgreater} 1011 M ⊙ have disks in their rest-frame optical morphologies. The prevalence of these extended, relatively undisturbed disks challenges the merging scenario as the main mode of massive galaxy formation.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis from new multi-wavelength observations of the exceptional galaxy cluster ACT-CL J0102-4915 "El Gordo," likely the most massive, hottest, most X-ray luminous and brightest Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect cluster known at z{\textgreater}0.6. The Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaboration discovered El Gordo as the most significant SZ decrement in a sky survey area of 755 deg{\^{}}2. Our VLT/FORS2 spectra of 89 member galaxies yield a cluster redshift, z=0.870, and velocity dispersion, s=1321+/-106 km/s. Our Chandra observations reveal a hot and X-ray luminous system with an integrated temperature of Tx=14.5+/-1.0 keV and 0.5-2.0 keV band luminosity of Lx=(2.19+/-0.11)x10{\^{}}45 h70{\^{}}-2 erg/s. We obtain several statistically consistent cluster mass estimates; using mass scaling relations with velocity dispersion, X-ray Yx, and integrated SZ, we estimate a cluster mass of M200a=(2.16+/-0.32)x10{\^{}}15 M{\_}sun/h70. The Chandra and VLT/FORS2 optical data also reveal that El Gordo is undergoing a major merger between components with a mass ratio of approximately 2 to 1. The X-ray data show significant temperature variations from a low of 6.6+/-0.7 keV at the merging low-entropy, high-metallicity, cool core to a high of 22+/-6 keV. We also see a wake in the X-ray surface brightness caused by the passage of one cluster through the other. Archival radio data at 843 MHz reveal diffuse radio emission that, if associated with the cluster, indicates the presence of an intense double radio relic, hosted by the highest redshift cluster yet. El Gordo is possibly a high-redshift analog of the famous Bullet Cluster. Such a massive cluster at this redshift is rare, although consistent with the standard L-CDM cosmology in the lower part of its allowed mass range. Massive, high-redshift mergers like El Gordo are unlikely to be reproduced in the current generation of numerical N-body cosmological simulations.},

abstract = {We present a Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 weak-lensing study of A520, where a previous analysis of ground-based data suggested the presence of a dark mass concentration. We map the complex mass structure in much greater detail leveraging more than a factor of three increase in the number density of source galaxies available for lensing analysis. The "dark core" that is coincident with the X-ray gas peak, but not with any stellar luminosity peak is now detected with more than 10 sigma significance. The {\~{}}1.5 Mpc filamentary structure elongated in the NE-SW direction is also clearly visible. Taken at face value, the comparison among the centroids of dark matter, intracluster medium, and galaxy luminosity is at odds with what has been observed in other merging clusters with a similar geometric configuration. To date, the most remarkable counter-example might be the Bullet Cluster, which shows a distinct bow-shock feature as in A520, but no significant weak-lensing mass concentration around the X-ray gas. With the most up-to-date data, we consider several possible explanations that might lead to the detection of this peculiar feature in A520. However, we conclude that none of these scenarios can be singled out yet as the definite explanation for this puzzle.},

abstract = {The Spitzer Extended Deep Survey (SEDS) is a very deep infrared survey within five well-known extragalactic science fields: the UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey, the Extended Chandra Deep Field South, COSMOS, the Hubble Deep Field North, and the Extended Groth Strip. SEDS covers a total area of 1.46 deg2 to a depth of 26 AB mag (3$\sigma$) in both of the warm Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) bands at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m. Because of its uniform depth of coverage in so many widely-separated fields, SEDS is subject to roughly 25{\%} smaller errors due to cosmic variance than a single-field survey of the same size. SEDS was designed to detect and characterize galaxies from intermediate to high redshifts (z = 2-7) with a built-in means of assessing the impact of cosmic variance on the individual fields. Because the full SEDS depth was accumulated in at least three separate visits to each field, typically with six-month intervals between visits, SEDS also furnishes an opportunity to assess the infrared variability of faint objects. This paper describes the SEDS survey design, processing, and publicly-available data products. Deep IRAC counts for the more than 300,000 galaxies detected by SEDS are consistent with models based on known galaxy populations. Discrete IRAC sources contribute 5.6 ± 1.0 and 4.4 ± 0.8 nW m-2 sr-1 at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m to the diffuse cosmic infrared background (CIB). IRAC sources cannot contribute more than half of the total CIB flux estimated from DIRBE data. Barring an unexpected error in the DIRBE flux estimates, half the CIB flux must therefore come from a diffuse component.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of a galaxy cluster at z = 1.62 located in the Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic survey XMM-LSS field. This structure was selected solely as an overdensity of galaxies with red Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera colors, satisfying ([3.6] - [4.5])AB{\textgreater} - 0.1 mag. Photometric redshifts derived from the Subaru XMM Deep Survey (BViz bands), the UKIRT Infrared Deep Survey-Ultra-Deep Survey (UKIDSS-UDS, JK bands), and from the Spitzer Public UDS survey (3.6-8.0 $\mu$m) show that this cluster corresponds to a surface density of galaxies at z ≈ 1.6 that is {\textgreater}20$\sigma$ above the mean at this redshift. We obtained optical spectroscopic observations of galaxies in the cluster region using IMACS on the Magellan telescope. We measured redshifts for seven galaxies in the range z = 1.62-1.63 within 2.8 arcmin ({\textless}1.4 Mpc) of the astrometric center of the cluster. A posteriori analysis of the XMM data in this field reveal a weak (4$\sigma$) detection in the [0.5-2 keV] band compatible with the expected thermal emission from such a cluster. The color-magnitude diagram of the galaxies in this cluster shows a prominent red sequence, dominated by a population of red galaxies with (z - J){\textgreater}1.7 mag. The photometric-redshift probability distributions for the red galaxies are strongly peaked at z = 1.62, coincident with the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies. The rest-frame (U - B) color and scatter of galaxies on the red sequence are consistent with a mean luminosity-weighted age of 1.2 ± 0.1 Gyr, yielding a formation redshift $\backslash$overline{\{}z{\_}f{\}}=2.35 ± 0.10, and corresponding to the last significant star formation period in these galaxies. This work is based in part on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under NASA contract 1407. This paper also includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.

abstract = {We present two new nonparametric methods for quantifying galaxy morphology: the relative distribution of the galaxy pixel flux values (the Gini coefficient or G) and the second-order moment of the brightest 20{\%} of the galaxy's flux (M20). We test the robustness of G and M20 to decreasing signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and spatial resolution and find that both measures are reliable to within 10{\%} for images with average S/N per pixel greater than 2 and resolutions better than 1000 and 500 pc, respectively. We have measured G and M20, as well as concentration (C), asymmetry (A), and clumpiness (S) in the rest-frame near-ultraviolet/optical wavelengths for 148 bright local ``normal'' Hubble-type galaxies (E-Sd) galaxies, 22 dwarf irregulars, and 73 0.05{\textless}z{\textless}0.25 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). We find that most local galaxies follow a tight sequence in G-M20-C, where early types have high G and C and low M20 and late-type spirals have lower G and C and higher M20. The majority of ULIRGs lie above the normal galaxy G-M20 sequence because of their high G and M20 values. Their high Gini coefficients arise from very bright nuclei, while the high second-order moments are produced by multiple nuclei and bright tidal tails. All of these features are signatures of recent and on-going mergers and interactions. We also find that in combination with A and S, G is more effective than C at distinguishing ULIRGs from the ``normal'' Hubble types. Finally, we measure the morphologies of 491.7{\textless}z{\textless}3.8 galaxies from HST NICMOS observations of the Hubble Deep Field North. We find that many of the z{\~{}}2 galaxies possess G and A higher than expected from degraded images of local elliptical and spiral galaxies and have morphologies more like low-redshift ULIRGs.},

abstract = {We present a cosmic shear study from the Deep Lens Survey (DLS), a deep BVRz multi-band imaging survey of five 4 sq. degree fields with two National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) 4-meter telescopes at Kitt Peak and Cerro Tololo. For both telescopes, the change of the point-spread-function (PSF) shape across the focal plane is complicated, and the exposure-to-exposure variation of this position-dependent PSF change is significant. We overcome this challenge by modeling the PSF separately for individual exposures and CCDs with principal component analysis (PCA). We find that stacking these PSFs reproduces the final PSF pattern on the mosaic image with high fidelity, and the method successfully separates PSF-induced systematics from gravitational lensing effects. We calibrate our shears and estimate the errors, utilizing an image simulator, which generates sheared ground-based galaxy images from deep Hubble Space Telescope archival data with a realistic atmospheric turbulence model. For cosmological parameter constraints, we marginalize over shear calibration error, photometric redshift uncertainty, and the Hubble constant. We use cosmology-dependent covariances for the Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis and find that the role of this varying covariance is critical in our parameter estimation. Our current non-tomographic analysis alone constrains the Omega{\_}M-sigma{\_}8 likelihood contour tightly, providing a joint constraint of Omega{\_}M=0.262+-0.051 and sigma{\_}8=0.868+-0.071. We expect that a future DLS weak-lensing tomographic study will further tighten these constraints because explicit treatment of the redshift dependence of cosmic shear more efficiently breaks the Omega{\_}M-sigma{\_}8 degeneracy. Combining the current results with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7-year (WMAP7) likelihood data, we obtain Omega{\_}M=0.278+-0.018 and sigma{\_}8=0.815+-0.020.},

With a new statistical test that looks for deviations of the local velocity mean and dispersion from the global values, it is found that most of the clusters in the sample show significant subclustering.

This result is in good agreement with earlier work by Geller and Beers (1982) based on number counts. The large fraction of clusters with significant substructure, along with evidence based on radial-velocity dispersion profiles, suggest that many, perhaps most, rich clusters did not collapse in single, coherent events.},

abstract = {The DEEP2 and COMBO-17 surveys are compared to study luminosity functions of red and blue galaxies to z{\~{}}1. The two surveys have different methods and sensitivities, but nevertheless results agree. After z{\~{}}1, M*B has dimmed by 1.2-1.3 mag for all colors of galaxies, $\phi$* for blue galaxies has hardly changed, and $\phi$* for red galaxies has at least doubled (our formal value is {\~{}}0.5 dex). Luminosity density jB has fallen by 0.6 dex for blue galaxies but has remained nearly constant for red galaxies. These results imply that the number and total stellar mass of blue galaxies have been substantially constant since z{\~{}}1, whereas those of red galaxies (near L*) have been significantly rising. To explain the new red galaxies, a ``mixed'' scenario is proposed in which star formation in blue cloud galaxies is quenched, causing them to migrate to the red sequence, where they merge further in a small number of stellar mergers. This mixed scenario matches the local boxy-disky transition for nearby ellipticals, as well as red sequence stellar population scaling laws such as the color-magnitude and Mg-$\sigma$ relations (which are explained as fossil relics from blue progenitors). Blue galaxies enter the red sequence via different quenching modes, each of which peaks at a different characteristic mass and time. The red sequence therefore likely builds up in different ways at different times and masses, and the concept of a single process that is ``downsizing'' (or upsizing) probably does not apply. Our claim in this paper of a rise in the number of red galaxies applies to galaxies near L*. Accurate counts of brighter galaxies on the steep part of the Schechter function require more accurate photometry than is currently available. Based on observations taken at the W. M.

abstract = {Random forests were introduced as a machine learning tool in Breiman (2001) and have since proven to be very popular and powerful for high-dimensional regression and classification. For regression, random forests give an accurate approximation of the conditional mean of a response variable. It is shown here that random forests provide information about the full conditional distribution of the response variable, not only about the conditional mean. Conditional quantiles can be inferred with quantile regression forests, a generalisation of random forests. Quantile regression forests give a non-parametric and accurate way of estimating conditional quantiles for high-dimensional predictor variables. The algorithm is shown to be consistent. Numerical examples suggest that the algorithm is competitive in terms of predictive power.},

abstract = {Distant star-forming galaxies show a correlation between their star-formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses, and this has deep implications for galaxy formation. Here, we present a study on the evolution of the slope and scatter of the SFR{\$}-{\$}stellar mass relation for galaxies at {\$}3.5\backslashleq z\backslashleq 6.5{\$} using multi-wavelength photometry in GOODS-S from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) and Spitzer Extended Deep Survey. We describe an updated, Bayesian spectral-energy distribution fitting method that incorporates effects of nebular line emission, star-formation histories that are constant or rising with time, and different dust attenuation prescriptions (starburst and Small Magellanic Cloud). From {\$}z{\$}=6.5 to {\$}z{\$}=3.5 star-forming galaxies in CANDELS follow a nearly unevolving correlation between stellar mass and SFR that follows SFR {\$}\backslashsim{\$} {\$}M{\_}\backslashstar{\^{}}\backslashalpha{\$} with {\$}\backslashalpha = 0.54 \backslashpm 0.16{\$} at {\$}z\backslashsim 6{\$} and {\$}0.70 \backslashpm 0.21{\$} at {\$}z\backslashsim 4{\$}. This evolution requires a star-formation history that increases with decreasing redshift (on average, the SFRs of individual galaxies rise with time).

We further show that the implied star-formation history of objects selected on the basis of their co-moving number densities is consistent with the evolution in the SFR{\$}-{\$}stellar mass relation.},

abstract = {We present a catalog of galaxy clusters selected using the maxBCG red-sequence method from Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometric data. This catalog includes 13,823 clusters with velocity dispersions greater than {\~{}}400 km s-1 and is the largest galaxy cluster catalog assembled to date. They are selected in an approximately volume-limited way from a 0.5 Gpc3 region covering 7500 deg2 of sky between redshifts 0.1 and 0.3. Each cluster contains between 10 and 190 E/S0 ridgeline galaxies brighter than 0.4L* within a scaled radius R200. The tight relation between ridgeline color and redshift provides an accurate photometric redshift estimate for every cluster. Photometric redshift errors are shown by comparison to spectroscopic redshifts to be small ($\Delta$z{\~{}}=0.01), essentially independent of redshift, and well determined throughout the redshift range. Runs of maxBCG on realistic mock catalogs suggest that the sample is more than 90{\%} pure and more than 85{\%} complete for clusters with masses {\textgreater}=1×1014 Msolar. Spectroscopic measurements of cluster members are used to examine line-of-sight projection as a contaminant in the identification of brightest cluster galaxies and cluster member galaxies. Spectroscopic data are also used to demonstrate the correlation between optical richness and velocity dispersion. Comparison to the combined NORAS and REFLEX X-ray-selected cluster catalogs shows that X-ray-luminous clusters are found among the optically richer maxBCG clusters. This paper is the first in a series that will consider the properties of these clusters, their galaxy populations, and their implications for cosmology.},

abstract = {We analyze very deep HST, VLT, and Spitzer photometry of galaxies at 2{\textless}z{\textless}3.5 in the Hubble Deep Field-South. The sample is selected from the deepest public K-band imaging currently available. We show that the rest-frame U-V versus V-J color-color diagram is a powerful diagnostic of the stellar populations of distant galaxies. Galaxies with red rest-frame U-V colors are generally red in rest-frame V-J as well. However, at a given U-V color a range in V-J colors exists, and we show that this allows us to distinguish young, dusty galaxies from old, passively evolving galaxies. We quantify the effects of IRAC photometry on estimates of masses, ages, and the dust content of z{\textgreater}2 galaxies. The estimated distributions of these properties do not change significantly when IRAC data are added to the UBVIJHK photometry. However, for individual galaxies the addition of IRAC can improve the constraints on the stellar populations, especially for red galaxies: uncertainties in stellar mass decrease by a factor of 2.7 for red [(U-V)rest{\textgreater}1] galaxies, but only by a factor of 1.3 for blue [(U-V)rest{\textless}1] galaxies. We find a similar color dependence of the improvement for estimates of age and dust extinction. In addition, the improvement from adding IRAC depends on the availability of full NIR JHK coverage; if only K band were available, the mass uncertainties of blue galaxies would decrease by a more substantial factor of 1.9. Finally, we find that a trend of galaxy color with stellar mass is already present at z{\textgreater}2. The most massive galaxies at high redshift have red rest-frame U-V colors compared to lower mass galaxies, even when allowing for complex star formation histories.

abstract = {Using a large N-body cosmological simulation combined with a subgrid treatment of galaxy formation, merging, and tidal destruction, we study the formation and evolution of the galaxy and cluster population in a comoving volume (100 Mpc)3 in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. At z = 0, our computational volume contains 1788 clusters with mass M cl {\textgreater} 1.1 × 1012 M ⊙, including 18 massive clusters with M cl {\textgreater} 1014 M ⊙. It also contains 1, 088, 797 galaxies with mass M gal {\textgreater}= 2 × 109 M ⊙ and luminosity L {\textgreater} 9.5 × 105 L ⊙. For each cluster, we identified the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We then computed two separate statistics: the fraction f BNC of clusters in which the BCG is not the closest galaxy to the center of the cluster in projection, and the ratio $\Delta$v/$\sigma$, where $\Delta$v is the difference in radial velocity between the BCG and the whole cluster and $\sigma$ is the radial velocity dispersion of the cluster. We found that f BNC increases from 0.05 for low-mass clusters (M cl {\~{}} 1012 M ⊙) to 0.5 for high-mass clusters (M cl {\textgreater} 1014 M ⊙) with very little dependence on cluster redshift. Most of this result turns out to be a projection effect and when we consider three-dimensional distances instead of projected distances, f BNC increases only to 0.2 at high-cluster mass. The values of $\Delta$v/$\sigma$ vary from 0 to 1.8, with median values in the range 0.03-0.15 when considering all clusters, and 0.12-0.31 when considering only massive clusters. These results are consistent with previous observational studies and indicate that the central galaxy paradigm, which states that the BCG should be at rest at the center of the cluster, is usually valid, but exceptions are too common to be ignored. We built merger trees for the 18 most massive clusters in the simulation. Analysis of these trees reveal that 16 of these clusters have experienced 1 or several major or semi-major mergers in the past. These mergers leave each cluster in a non-equilibrium state, but eventually the cluster settles into an equilibrium configuration, unless it is disturbed by another major or semi-major merger. We found evidence that these mergers are responsible for the off-center positions and peculiar velocities of some BCGs. Our results thus support the merging-group scenario, in which some clusters form by the merging of smaller groups in which the galaxies have already formed, including the galaxy destined to become the BCG. Finally, we argue that f BNC is not a very robust statistics, as it is very sensitive to projection and selection effects, but that $\Delta$v/$\sigma$ is more robust. Still, both statistics exhibit a signature of major mergers between clusters of galaxies.},

abstract = {Observations have revealed prodigious amounts of star formation in starburst galaxies as traced by dust and molecular emission, even at large redshifts. Recent work shows that for both nearby spiral galaxies and distant starbursts, the global star formation rate, as indicated by the infrared luminosity, has a tight and almost linear correlation with the amount of dense gas as traced by the luminosity of HCN. Our surveys of Galactic dense cores in HCN 1-0 emission show that this correlation continues to a much smaller scale, with nearly the same ratio of infrared luminosity to HCN luminosity found over 7-8 orders of magnitude in LIR, with a lower cutoff around 104.5 Lsolar of infrared luminosity. The linear correlation suggests that we may understand distant star formation in terms of the known properties of local star-forming regions. Both the correlation and the luminosity cutoff can be explained if the basic unit of star formation in galaxies is a dense core, similar to those studied in our Galaxy.},

abstract = {(abridged) We present cosmological constraints obtained from galaxy clusters identified by their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect signature in the 2500 square degree South Pole Telescope Sunyaev Zel'dovich survey. We consider the 377 cluster candidates identified at z{\textgreater}0.25 with a detection significance greater than five, corresponding to the 95{\%} purity threshold for the survey. We compute constraints on cosmological models using the measured cluster abundance as a function of mass and redshift. We include additional constraints from multi-wavelength observations, including Chandra X-ray data for 82 clusters and a weak lensing-based prior on the normalization of the mass-observable scaling relations. Assuming a LCDM cosmology, where the species-summed neutrino mass has the minimum allowed value (mnu = 0.06 eV) from neutrino oscillation experiments, we combine the cluster data with a prior on H0 and find sigma{\_}8 = 0.797+-0.031 and Omega{\_}m = 0.289+-0.042, with the parameter combination sigma{\_}8(Omega{\_}m/0.27){\^{}}0.3 = 0.784+-0.039. These results are in good agreement with constraints from the CMB from SPT, WMAP, and Planck, as well as with constraints from other cluster datasets. Adding mnu as a free parameter, we find mnu = 0.14+-0.08 eV when combining the SPT cluster data with Planck CMB data and BAO data, consistent with the minimum allowed value. Finally, we consider a cosmology where mnu and N{\_}eff are fixed to the LCDM values, but the dark energy equation of state parameter w is free. Using the SPT cluster data in combination with an H0 prior, we measure w = -1.28+-0.31, a constraint consistent with the LCDM cosmological model and derived from the combination of growth of structure and geometry. When combined with primarily geometrical constraints from Planck CMB, H0, BAO and SNe, adding the SPT cluster data improves the w constraint from the geometrical data alone by 14{\%}, to w = -1.023+-0.042.},

abstract = {We analyze the resolved stellar populations of 473 massive star-forming galaxies at 0.7 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5, with multi-wavelength broad-band imaging from CANDELS and Halpha surface brightness profiles at the same kiloparsec resolution from 3D-HST. Together, this unique data set sheds light on how the assembled stellar mass is distributed within galaxies, and where new stars are being formed. We find the Halpha morphologies to resemble more closely those observed in the ACS I band than in the WFC3 H band, especially for the larger systems. We next derive a novel prescription for Halpha dust corrections, which accounts for extra extinction towards HII regions. The prescription leads to consistent SFR estimates and reproduces the observed relation between the Halpha/UV luminosity ratio and visual extinction, both on a pixel-by-pixel and on a galaxy-integrated level. We find the surface density of star formation to correlate with the surface density of assembled stellar mass for spatially resolved regions within galaxies, akin to the so-called 'main sequence of star formation' established on a galaxy-integrated level. Deviations from this relation towards lower equivalent widths are found in the inner regions of galaxies. Clumps and spiral features, on the other hand, are associated with enhanced Halpha equivalent widths, bluer colors, and higher specific star formation rates compared to the underlying disk. Their Halpha/UV luminosity ratio is lower than that of the underlying disk, suggesting the ACS clump selection preferentially picks up those regions of elevated star formation activity that are the least obscured by dust. Our analysis emphasizes that monochromatic studies of galaxy structure can be severely limited by mass-to-light ratio variations due to dust and spatially inhomogeneous star formation histories.},

abstract = {We present a velocity-dispersion-based mass calibration of the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect survey (SPT-SZ) galaxy cluster sample. Using a homogeneously selected sample of 100 cluster candidates from 720 deg2 of the survey along with 63 velocity dispersion ($\sigma$ v ) and 16 X-ray Y X measurements of sample clusters, we simultaneously calibrate the mass-observable relation and constrain cosmological parameters. Our method accounts for cluster selection, cosmological sensitivity, and uncertainties in the mass calibrators. The calibrations using $\sigma$ v and Y X are consistent at the 0.6$\sigma$ level, with the $\sigma$ v calibration preferring {\~{}}16{\%} higher masses. We use the full SPTCL data set (SZ clusters+$\sigma$ v +Y X) to measure $\sigma$8($\Omega$m/0.27)0.3 = 0.809 ± 0.036 within a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The SPT cluster abundance is lower than preferred by either the WMAP9 or Planck+WMAP9 polarization (WP) data, but assuming that the sum of the neutrino masses is ∑m $\nu$ = 0.06 eV, we find the data sets to be consistent at the 1.0$\sigma$ level for WMAP9 and 1.5$\sigma$ for Planck+WP. Allowing for larger ∑m $\nu$ further reconciles the results. When we combine the SPTCL and Planck+WP data sets with information from baryon acoustic oscillations and Type Ia supernovae, the preferred cluster masses are 1.9$\sigma$ higher than the Y X calibration and 0.8$\sigma$ higher than the $\sigma$ v calibration. Given the scale of these shifts ({\~{}}44{\%} and {\~{}}23{\%} in mass, respectively), we execute a goodness-of-fit test; it reveals no tension, indicating that the best-fit model provides an adequate description of the data. Using the multi-probe data set, we measure $\Omega$m = 0.299 ± 0.009 and $\sigma$8 = 0.829 ± 0.011. Within a $\nu$CDM model we find ∑m $\nu$ = 0.148 ± 0.081 eV. We present a consistency test of the cosmic growth rate using SPT clusters. Allowing both the growth index $\gamma$ and the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w to vary, we find $\gamma$ = 0.73 ± 0.28 and w = -1.007 ± 0.065, demonstrating that the expansion and the growth histories are consistent with a $\Lambda$CDM universe ($\gamma$ = 0.55; w = -1).},

abstract = {We discuss the structural and morphological properties of galaxies in a z=1.62 proto-cluster using near-IR imaging data from Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 data of the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS). The cluster galaxies exhibit a clear color-morphology relation: galaxies with colors of quiescent stellar populations generally have morphologies consistent with spheroids, and galaxies with colors consistent with ongoing star formation have disk-like and irregular morphologies. The size distribution of the quiescent cluster galaxies shows a deficit of compact ({\textless} 1kpc), massive galaxies compared to CANDELS field galaxies at z=1.6. As a result the cluster quiescent galaxies have larger average effective sizes compared to field galaxies at fixed mass at greater than 90{\%} significance. Combined with data from the literature, the size evolution of quiescent cluster galaxies is relatively slow from z{\~{}}1.6 to the present, growing as (1+z){\^{}}(-0.6+/-0.1). If this result is generalizable, then it implies that physical processes associated with the denser cluster region seems to have caused accelerated size growth in quiescent galaxies prior to z=1.6 and slower subsequent growth at z{\textless}1.6 compared to galaxies in the lower density field. The quiescent cluster galaxies at z=1.6 have higher ellipticities compared to lower redshift samples at fixed mass, and their surface-brightness profiles suggest that they contain extended stellar disks. We argue the cluster galaxies require dissipationless (i.e., gas-poor or "dry") mergers to reorganize the disk material and to match the relations for ellipticity, stellar mass, size, and color of early-type galaxies in z{\textless}1 clusters.},

abstract = {The brightest galaxy in a dark matter halo is expected to reside at rest at the centre of the halo. In this paper, we test this `Central Galaxy Paradigm' (CGP) using group catalogues extracted from the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). For each group, we compute a parameter , which is defined as the difference between the velocity of the brightest group galaxy and the average velocity of the other group members (hereafter satellites), normalized by the unbiased estimator of the velocity dispersion of the satellite galaxies. Because the redshift surveys suffer from incompleteness effects and the group selection criterion unavoidably selects interlopers, a proper comparison between data and model needs to take this into account. To this extent, we use detailed mock galaxy redshift surveys (MGRSs), which are analysed in exactly the same way as the data, thus allowing for a fair comparison. We show that the CGP is only consistent with the data in haloes with M{\textless}{\~{}} 1013h-1 Msolar, while in more massive haloes the data indicate a non-zero offset between the brightest galaxy and the satellites. This indicates that either central galaxies reside at the minimum of the dark matter potential, but that the halo itself is not yet fully relaxed, or, that the halo is relaxed, but that the central galaxy oscillates in its potential well. The former is consistent with the fact that the velocity bias of the brightest halo galaxies is larger in more massive haloes, while the latter may be indicative of cored, rather than cusped, dark matter haloes. We discuss several implications of these findings, including mass estimates based on satellite kinematics, strong gravitational lensing, halo occupation models, and the frequency and longevity of lopsidedness in disc galaxies.},

abstract = {We use the high quality pressure profiles of 239 galaxy clusters made available by the ACCEPT project (Cavagnolo et al. 2009) in order to derive the expected Sunyaev Zeldovich (SZ) signal in a variety of cases that hardly find a counterpart in the simulations. We made use of the Melin et al. (2006) cluster selection function for both the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck instruments. We infer a clear effect of the cool core (CC) on the central Compton parameter y{\_}0. We find that the presence of CCs introduces a small bias in cluster detection, especially around the mass at which the performance of the survey begins to decrease. If the CC were removed, a lower overall fraction of detected clusters would be expected. In order to estimate the presence of such a bias by means of SZ only surveys, we show that the ratio between y{\_}0 and y{\_}int anti-correlates with the cluster central cooling time. If multi-band optical cluster surveys are either available for a cross-match or a follow-up is planned, we suggest that likely CC clusters are those with a Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) at least 0.3 magnitudes bluer than the average. A more robust estimate of the CC presence is given by UV-optical colours of the BCG, like the NUV-r, whose values can be 4 magnitudes off the NUV-r equivalent of the red sequence, in clusters with low excess entropy. We also find correlation of the y{\_}0/y{\_}int ratio with Halpha, IR and radio luminosities. We argue that the analysis of a combined SZ/optical/UV surveys can be also used to shed light on the suggested CC evolution with redshift. (abridged)},

abstract = {Aims. We present a stand-alone software (named EXSdetect) for the detection of extended sources in X-ray images. Our goal is to provide a flexible tool capable of detecting extended sources down to the lowest flux levels attainable within instrumental limitations, while maintaining robust photometry, high completeness, and low contamination, regardless of source morphology. EXSdetect was developed mainly to exploit the ever-increasing wealth of archival X-ray data, but is also ideally suited to explore the scientific capabilities of future X-ray facilities, with a strong focus on investigations of distant groups and clusters of galaxies. Methods. EXSdetect combines a fast Voronoi tessellation code with a friends-of-friends algorithm and an automated deblending procedure. The values of key parameters are matched to fundamental telescope properties such as angular resolution and instrumental background. In addition, the software is designed to permit extensive tests of its performance via simulations of a wide range of observational scenarios. Results. We applied EXSdetect to simulated data fields modeled to realistically represent the Swift X-ray Cluster Survey (SXCS), which is based on archival data obtained by the X-ray telescope onboard the Swift satellite. We achieve more than 90{\%} completeness for extended sources comprising at least 80 photons in the 0.5-2 keV band, a limit that corresponds to 10{\^{}}-14 erg cm{\^{}}-2 s{\^{}}-1 for the deepest SXCS fields. This detection limit is comparable to the one attained by the most sensitive cluster surveys conducted with much larger X-ray telescopes. While evaluating the performance of EXSdetect, we also explored the impact of improved angular resolution and discuss the ideal properties of the next generation of X-ray survey missions.},

abstract = {We present a first cosmological analysis of a refined cluster catalog from the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS). The input cluster sample is derived from the deepest 72.07 deg2 of the RCS images, which probe to the highest redshift and lowest mass limits. The catalog contains 956 clusters over 0.35{\textless}z{\textless}0.95, limited by cluster richness and richness error. The calibration of the survey images has been extensively cross-checked against publicly available Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging, and the cluster redshifts and richness that result from this well-calibrated subset of data are robust. We analyze the cluster sample via a general self-calibration technique. We fit simultaneously for the matter density, $\Omega$m, the normalization of the power spectrum, $\sigma$8, and four parameters describing the calibration of cluster richness to mass, its evolution with redshift, and scatter in the mass-richness relation. The principal goal of this general analysis is to establish the consistency (or lack thereof) between the fitted parameters (both cosmological and cluster mass observables) and available results on both from independent measures. From an unconstrained analysis, the derived values of $\Omega$m and $\sigma$8 are 0.31+0.11-0.10 and 0.67+0.18-0.13, respectively. An analysis including Gaussian priors on the slope and zero point of the mass-richness relation gives very similar results: 0.30+0.12-0.11 and 0.70+0.27-0.15. Both analyses are in acceptable agreement with the current literature. The derived parameters describing the mass-richness relation in the unconstrained fit are also eminently reasonable and in good agreement with existing follow-up data on both the RCS-1 and other cluster samples. Our results directly demonstrate that future surveys (optical and otherwise), with much larger samples of clusters, can give constraints competitive with other probes of cosmology.

abstract = {Radiation, winds, and jets from the active nucleus of a massive galaxy can interact with its interstellar medium, and this can lead to ejection or heating of the gas. This terminates star formation in the galaxy and stifles accretion onto the black hole. Such active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can account for the observed proportionality between the central black hole and the host galaxy mass. Direct observational evidence for the radiative or quasar mode of feedback, which occurs when AGN are very luminous, has been difficult to obtain but is accumulating from a few exceptional objects. Feedback from the kinetic or radio mode, which uses the mechanical energy of radio-emitting jets often seen when AGN are operating at a lower level, is common in massive elliptical galaxies. This mode is well observed directly through X-ray observations of the central galaxies of cool core clusters in the form of bubbles in the hot surrounding medium. The energy flow, which is roughly continuous, heats the hot intracluster gas and reduces radiative cooling and subsequent star formation by an order of magnitude. Feedback appears to maintain a long-lived heating/cooling balance. Powerful, jetted radio outbursts may represent a further mode of energy feedback that affects the cores of groups and subclusters. New telescopes and instruments from the radio to X-ray bands will come into operation over the next several years and lead to a rapid expansion in observational data on all modes of AGN feedback.},

abstract = {With the advent of wide-field cosmological surveys, we are approaching samples of hundreds of thousands of galaxy clusters. While such large numbers will help reduce statistical uncertainties, the control of systematics in cluster masses becomes ever more crucial. Here we examine the effects of an important source of systematic uncertainty in galaxy-based cluster mass estimation techniques: the presence of significant dynamical substructure. Dynamical substructure manifests as dynamically distinct subgroups in phase-space, indicating an 'unrelaxed' state. This issue affects around a quarter of clusters in a generally selected sample. We employ a set of mock clusters whose masses have been measured homogeneously with commonly-used galaxy-based mass estimation techniques (kinematic, richness, caustic, radial methods). We use these to study how the relation between observationally estimated and true cluster mass depends on the presence of substructure, as identified by various popular diagnostics. We find that the scatter for an ensemble of clusters does not increase dramatically for clusters with dynamical substructure. However, we find a systematic bias for all methods, such that clusters with significant substructure have higher measured masses than their relaxed counterparts. This bias depends on cluster mass: the most massive clusters are largely unaffected by the presence of significant substructure, but masses are significantly overestimated for lower mass clusters, by {\$}\backslashsim10\backslash{\%}{\$} at {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}}{\$} and {\$}\backslashgeq20\backslash{\%}{\$} for {\$}\backslashleq10{\^{}}{\{}13.5{\}}{\$}. The use of cluster samples with different levels of substructure can, therefore, bias certain cosmological parameters up to a level comparable to the typical uncertainties in current cosmological studies.},

abstract = {Imaging data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is used to measure the empirical size-richness relation for a large sample of galaxy clusters. Using population subtraction methods, we determine the radius at which the cluster galaxy number density is 200/Omega{\_}m times the mean galaxy density, without assuming a model for the radial distribution of galaxies in clusters. If these galaxies are unbiased on Mpc scales, this galaxy-density-based R{\_}200 reflects the characteristic radii of clusters. We measure the scaling of this characteristic radius with richness over an order of magnitude in cluster richness, from rich clusters to poor groups. We use this information to examine the radial profiles of galaxies in clusters as a function of cluster richness, finding that the concentration of the galaxy distribution decreases with richness and is systematically lower than the concentrations measured for dark matter profiles in N-body simulations. Using these scaled radii, we investigate the behavior of the cluster luminosity function, and find that it is well matched by a Schechter function for galaxies brighter than M{\_}r = -18 only after the central galaxy has been removed. We find that the luminosity function varies with richness and with distance from the cluster center, underscoring the importance of using an aperture that scales with cluster mass to compare physically equivalent regions of these different systems. We note that the lowest richness systems in our catalog have properties consistent with those expected of the earliest-forming halos; our cluster-finding algorithm, in addition to reliably finding clusters, may be efficient at finding fossil groups.},

By stacking the H$\alpha$ emission, we find that star formation occurred in approximately exponential distributions at z {\~{}} 1, with a median S{\'{e}}rsic index of n = 1.0 ± 0.2. The stacks are elongated with median axis ratios of b/a = 0.58 ± 0.09 in H$\alpha$ consistent with (possibly thick) disks at random orientation angles. Keck spectra obtained for a subset of eight of the galaxies show clear evidence for rotation, with inclination corrected velocities of 90-330 km s-1. The most straightforward interpretation of our results is that star formation in strongly star-forming galaxies at z {\~{}} 1 generally occurred in disks. The disks appear to be "scaled-up" versions of nearby spiral galaxies: they have EW(H$\alpha$) {\~{}} 100 {\AA} out to the solar orbit and they have star formation surface densities above the threshold for driving galactic scale winds.},

abstract = {A large sample of Abell clusters of galaxies, selected for the likely presence of a dominant galaxy, is used to study the dynamical properties of the brightest cluster members (BCMs). From visual inspection of Digitized Sky Survey images combined with redshift information we identify 1426 candidate BCMs located in 1221 different redshift components associated with 1169 different Abell clusters. This is the largest sample published so far of such galaxies. From our own morphological classification we find that {\~{}}92{\%} of the BCMs in our sample are early-type galaxies and 48{\%} are of cD type. We confirm what was previously observed based on much smaller samples, namely, that a large fraction of BCMs have significant peculiar velocities. From a subsample of 452 clusters having at least 10 measured radial velocities, we estimate a median BCM peculiar velocity of 32{\%} of their host clusters' radial velocity dispersion. This suggests that most BCMs are not at rest in the potential well of their clusters. This phenomenon is common to galaxy clusters in our sample, and not a special trait of clusters hosting cD galaxies. We show that the peculiar velocity of the BCM is independent of cluster richness and only slightly dependent on the Bautz-Morgan type. We also find a weak trend for the peculiar velocity to rise with the cluster velocity dispersion. The strongest dependence is with the morphological type of the BCM: cD galaxies tend to have lower relative peculiar velocities than elliptical galaxies. This result points to a connection between the formation of the BCMs and that of their clusters. Our data are qualitatively consistent with the merging-groups scenario, where BCMs in clusters formed first in smaller subsystems comparable to compact groups of galaxies. In this scenario, clusters would have formed recently from the mergers of many such groups and would still be in a dynamically unrelaxed state.},

abstract = {Using 10095 galaxies (B {\textless} 20mag) from the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue, we derive B-band luminosity distributions and selected bivariate brightness distributions for the galaxy population subdivided by eyeball morphology; S{\'{e}}rsic index (n); two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) $\eta$ parameter; rest-(u-r) colour (global and core); MGC continuum shape; half-light radius; (extrapolated) central surface brightness; and inferred stellar mass-to-light ratio. All subdivisions extract highly correlated subsets of the galaxy population which consistently point towards two overlapping distributions: an old, red, inert, predominantly luminous, high central-surface brightness subset; and a young, blue, star forming, intermediate surface brightness subset. A clear bimodality in the observed distribution is seen in both the rest-(u-r)colour and log (n) distributions. Whilst the former bimodality was well established from Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, we show here that the rest-(u-r) colour bimodality becomes more pronounced when using the core colour as opposed to global colour. The two populations are extremely well separated in the colour-log(n) plane. Using our sample of 3314 (B {\textless} 19mag) eyeball classified galaxies, we show that the bulge-dominated, early-type galaxies populate one peak and the bulge-less, late-type galaxies occupy the second. The early- and mid-type spirals sprawl across and between the peaks. This constitutes extremely strong evidence that the fundamental way to divide the luminous galaxy population (MBMGC- 5 logh {\textless} -16 mag, i.e. dwarfs not included) is into bulges (old red, inert, high concentration) and discs (young, blue, star forming, low concentration) and that the galaxy bimodality reflects the two-component nature of galaxies and not two distinct galaxy classes. We argue that these two components require two independent formation mechanisms/processes and advocate early bulge formation through initial collapse and ongoing disc formation through splashback, infall and merging/accretion. We calculate the B-band luminosity densities and stellar mass densities within each subdivision and estimate that the z{\~{}} 0 stellar mass content in spheroids, bulges and discs is 35 +/- 2, 18 +/- 7 and 47 +/- 7 per cent, respectively.},

abstract = {The Planck catalogue of SZ sources limits itself to a significance threshold of 4.5 to ensure a low contamination rate by false cluster candidates. This means that only the most massive clusters at redshift z{\textgreater}0.5, and in particular z{\textgreater}0.7, are expected to enter into the catalogue, with a large number of systems in that redshift regime being expected around and just below that threshold. In this paper, we follow-up a sample of SZ sources from the Planck SZ catalogues from 2013 and 2015. In the latter maps, we consider detections around and at lower significance than the threshold adopted by the Planck Collaboration. To keep the contamination rate low, our 28 candidates are chosen to have significant WISE detections, in combination with non-detections in SDSS/DSS, which effectively selects galaxy cluster candidates at redshifts {\$}z\backslashgtrsim0.5{\$}. By taking r- and z-band imaging with MegaCam@CFHT, we bridge the 4000A rest-frame break over a significant redshift range, thus allowing accurate redshift estimates of red-sequence cluster galaxies up to z{\~{}}0.8. After discussing the possibility that an overdensity of galaxies coincides -by chance- with a Planck SZ detection, we confirm that 16 of the candidates have likely optical counterparts to their SZ signals, 13 (6) of which have an estimated redshift z{\textgreater}0.5 (z{\textgreater}0.7). The richnesses of these systems are generally lower than expected given the halo masses estimated from the Planck maps. However, when we follow a simplistic model to correct for Eddington bias in the SZ halo mass proxy, the richnesses are consistent with a reference mass-richness relation established for clusters detected at higher significance. This illustrates the benefit of an optical follow-up, not only to obtain redshift estimates, but also to provide an independent mass proxy that is not based on the same data the clusters are detected with, and thus not subject to Eddington bias.},

abstract = {SPT-CL J2040-4451—spectroscopically confirmed at z = 1.478—is the highest-redshift galaxy cluster yet discovered via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. SPT-CL J2040-4451 was a candidate galaxy cluster identified in the first 720 deg2 of the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SPT-SZ) survey, and has been confirmed in follow-up imaging and spectroscopy. From multi-object spectroscopy with Magellan-I/Baade+IMACS we measure spectroscopic redshifts for 15 cluster member galaxies, all of which have strong [O II] $\lambda$$\lambda$3727 emission. SPT-CL J2040-4451 has an SZ-measured mass of M 500, SZ = 3.2 ± 0.8 × 1014 M ⊙ h {\_}{\{}70{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}, corresponding to M 200, SZ = 5.8 ± 1.4 × 1014 M ⊙ h {\_}{\{}70{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}. The velocity dispersion measured entirely from blue star-forming members is $\sigma$ v = 1500 ± 520 km s-1. The prevalence of star-forming cluster members (galaxies with {\textgreater}1.5 M ⊙ yr-1) implies that this massive, high-redshift cluster is experiencing a phase of active star formation, and supports recent results showing a marked increase in star formation occurring in galaxy clusters at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1.4. We also compute the probability of finding a cluster as rare as this in the SPT-SZ survey to be {\textgreater}99{\%}, indicating that its discovery is not in tension with the concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model.},

abstract = {We provide a new observational test for a key prediction of the $\backslash$Lambda CDM cosmological model: the contributions of mergers with different halo-to-main-cluster mass ratios to cluster-sized halo growth. We perform this test by dynamically analyzing seven galaxy clusters, spanning the redshift range {\$}0.13 {\textless} z{\_}c {\textless} 0.45{\$} and caustic mass range {\$}0.4-1.5{\$} {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}15{\}} h{\_}{\{}0.73{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, with an average of 293 spectroscopically-confirmed bound galaxies to each cluster. The large radial coverage (a few virial radii), which covers the whole infall region, with a high number of spectroscopically identified galaxies enables this new study. For each cluster, we identify bound galaxies. Out of these galaxies, we identify infalling and accreted halos and estimate their masses and their dynamical states. Using the estimated masses, we derive the contribution of different mass ratios to cluster-sized halo growth. For mass ratios between {\~{}}0.2 and {\~{}}0.7, we find a {\~{}}1 {\$}\backslashsigma{\$} agreement with $\backslash$Lambda CDM expectations based on the Millennium simulations I and II. At low mass ratios, {\$}\backslashlesssim 0.2{\$}, our derived contribution is underestimated since the detection efficiency decreases at low masses, {\$}\backslashsim 2 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}}{\$} {\$}h{\_}{\{}0.73{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}. At large mass ratios, {\$}\backslashgtrsim 0.7{\$}, we do not detect halos probably because our sample, which was chosen to be quite X-ray relaxed, is biased against large mass ratios. Therefore, at large mass ratios, the derived contribution is also underestimated.},

abstract = {We present deep near-infrared (NIR) medium-bandwidth photometry over the wavelength range 1-1.8 microns in the All-wavelength Extended Groth strip International Survey (AEGIS) and Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) fields. The observations were carried out as part of the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey (NMBS), an NOAO survey program on the Mayall 4m telescope on Kitt Peak using the NOAO Extremely Wide-Field Infrared Imager (NEWFIRM). In this paper, we describe the full details of the observations, data reduction and photometry for the survey. We also present a public K-selected photometric catalog, along with accurate photometric redshifts. The redshifts are computed with 37 (20) filters in the COSMOS (AEGIS) fields, combining the NIR medium-bandwidth data with existing ultraviolet (UV; Galaxy Evolution Explorer), visible and NIR (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and Subaru) and mid-IR (Spitzer/IRAC) imaging. We find excellent agreement with publicly available spectroscopic redshifts, with sigma{\_}z/(1+z){\~{}}1-2{\%} for {\~{}}4000 galaxies at z=0-3. The NMBS catalogs contain {\~{}}13,000 galaxies at z{\textgreater}1.5 with accurate photometric redshifts and rest-frame colors. Due to the increased spectral resolution obtained with the five NIR medium-band filters, the median 68{\%} confidence intervals of the photometric redshifts of both quiescent and star-forming galaxies are a factor of {\~{}}2 times smaller when comparing catalogs with medium-band NIR photometry to NIR broadband photometry. We show evidence for a clear bimodal color distribution between quiescent and star-forming galaxies that persists to z{\~{}}3, a higher redshift than has been probed so far.},

abstract = {The appearance of active galactic nuclei (AGN) depends so strongly on orientation that our current classification schemes are dominated by random pointing directions instead of more interesting physical properties. Light from the centers of many AGN is obscured by optically thick circumnuclear matter and in radio-loud AGN, bipolar jets emanating from the nucleus emit light that is relativistically beamed along the jet axes. Understanding the origin and magnitude of radiation anisotropies in AGN allows us to unify different classes of AGN; that is, to identify each single, underlying AGN type that gives rise to different classes through different orientations. This review describes the unification of radio-loud AGN, which include radio galaxies, quasars, and blazars. We describe the classification and properties of AGN and summarize the evidence for anisotropic emission. We outline the two most plausible unified schemes for radio-loud AGN, one linking quasars and luminous radio galaxies and another linking BL{\~{}}Lac objects and less luminous radio galaxies. Using the formalism appropriate to samples biased by relativistic beaming, we show the population statistics for two schemes are in accordance with available data. We analyze the possible connections between low- and high-luminosity radio-loud AGN. We review potential difficulties with unification and conclude that none currently constitutes a serious problem. We discuss likely complications to unified schemes that are suggested by realistic physical considerations; these will be important to consider when more comprehensive data for larger complete samples become available. We conclude with a list of the ten questions we believe are the most pressing in this field.},

abstract = {We perform the first fit to the anisotropic clustering of SDSS-III CMASS DR10 galaxies on scales of {\~{}} 0.8 - 32 Mpc/h. A standard halo occupation distribution model evaluated near the best fit Planck LCDM cosmology provides a good fit to the observed anisotropic clustering, and implies a normalization for the peculiar velocity field of M {\~{}} 2 x 10{\^{}}13 Msun/h halos of f*sigma8(z=0.57) = 0.450 +/- 0.011. Since this constraint includes both quasi-linear and non-linear scales, it should severely constrain modified gravity models that enhance pairwise infall velocities on these scales. Though model dependent, our measurement represents a factor of 2.5 improvement in precision over the analysis of DR11 on large scales, f*sigma8(z=0.57) = 0.447 +/- 0.028, and is the tightest single constraint on the growth rate of cosmic structure to date. Our measurement is consistent with the Planck LCDM prediction of 0.480 +/- 0.010 at the {\~{}}1.9 sigma level. Assuming a halo mass function evaluated at the best fit Planck cosmology, we also find that 10{\%} of CMASS galaxies are satellites in halos of mass M {\~{}} 6 x 10{\^{}}13 Msun/h. While none of our tests and model generalizations indicate systematic errors due to an insufficiently detailed model of the galaxy-halo connection, the precision of these first results warrant further investigation into the modeling uncertainties and degeneracies with cosmological parameters.},

abstract = {We report weak-lensing masses for 51 of the most X-ray luminous galaxy clusters known. This cluster sample, introduced earlier in this series of papers, spans redshifts 0.15 {\textless} z{\_}cl {\textless} 0.7, and is well suited to calibrate mass proxies for current cluster cosmology experiments. Cluster masses are measured with a standard `color-cut' lensing method from three-filter photometry of each field. Additionally, for 27 cluster fields with at least five-filter photometry, we measure high-accuracy masses using a new method that exploits all information available in the photometric redshift posterior probability distributions of individual galaxies. Using simulations based on the COSMOS-30 catalog, we demonstrate control of systematic biases in the mean mass of the sample with this method, from photometric redshift biases and associated uncertainties, to better than 3{\%}. In contrast, we show that the use of single-point estimators in place of the full photometric redshift posterior distributions can lead to significant redshift-dependent biases on cluster masses. The performance of our new photometric redshift-based method allows us to calibrate `color-cut` masses for all 51 clusters in the present sample to a total systematic uncertainty of {\~{}}7{\%} on the mean mass, a level sufficient to significantly improve current cosmology constraints from galaxy clusters. Our results bode well for future cosmological studies of clusters, potentially reducing the need for exhaustive spectroscopic calibration surveys as compared to other techniques, when deep, multi-filter optical and near-IR imaging surveys are coupled with robust photometric redshift methods.},

abstract = {eROSITA is the primary instrument on the Russian SRG mission. In the first four years of scientific operation after its launch, foreseen for 2014, it will perform a deep survey of the entire X-ray sky. In the soft X-ray band (0.5-2 keV), this will be about 20 times more sensitive than the ROSAT all sky survey, while in the hard band (2-10 keV) it will provide the first ever true imaging survey of the sky at those energies. Such a sensitive all-sky survey will revolutionize our view of the high-energy sky, and calls for major efforts in synergic, multi-wavelength wide area surveys in order to fully exploit the scientific potential of the X-ray data. The design-driving science of eROSITA is the detection of very large samples ({\~{}}10{\^{}}5 objects) of galaxy clusters out to redshifts z{\textgreater}1, in order to study the large scale structure in the Universe, test and characterize cosmological models including Dark Energy. eROSITA is also expected to yield a sample of around 3 millions Active Galactic Nuclei, including both obscured and un-obscured objects, providing a unique view of the evolution of supermassive black holes within the emerging cosmic structure. The survey will also provide new insights into a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, including accreting binaries, active stars and diffuse emission within the Galaxy, as well as solar system bodies that emit X-rays via the charge exchange process. Finally, such a deep imaging survey at high spectral resolution, with its scanning strategy sensitive to a range of variability timescales from tens of seconds to years, will undoubtedly open up a vast discovery space for the study of rare, unpredicted, or unpredictable high-energy astrophysical phenomena. In this living document we present a comprehensive description of the main scientific goals of the mission, with strong emphasis on the early survey phases.},

The redshifts are computed with 30 broad, intermediate, and narrow bands covering the UV (GALEX), Visible-NIR (Subaru, CFHT, UKIRT and NOAO) and mid-IR (Spitzer/IRAC). A chi2 template-fitting method (Le Phare) was used and calibrated with large spectroscopic samples from VLT-VIMOS and Keck-DEIMOS. We develop and implement a new method which accounts for the contributions from emission lines (OII, Hbeta, Halpha and Ly) to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The treatment of emission lines improves the photo-z accuracy by a factor of 2.5. Comparison of the derived photo-z with 4148 spectroscopic redshifts (i.e. Delta z = zs - zp) indicates a dispersion of sigma{\_}{\{}Delta z/(1+zs){\}}=0.007 at i{\textless}22.5, a factor of 2-6 times more accurate than earlier photo-z in the COSMOS, CFHTLS and COMBO-17 survey fields.

In total, deep, direct images of more than one hundred fields were obtained in multiple filters. We identified 47 previously unknown galaxy clusters, 41 of which are included in the Planck catalogue of SZ sources. The redshifts of 65 Planck clusters were measured spectroscopically and 14 more were measured photometrically. We discuss the details of cluster optical identifications and redshift measurements.

abstract = {The presence of massive, compact, quiescent galaxies at z{\textgreater}2 presents a major challenge for theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution. Using one of the deepest large public near-IR surveys to date, we investigate in detail the correlations between star formation and galaxy structural parameters (size, stellar mass, and surface density) from z = 2 to the present. At all redshifts, massive quiescent galaxies (i.e., those with little or no star formation) occupy the extreme high end of the surface density distribution and follow a tight mass-size correlation, while star-forming galaxies show a broad range of both densities and sizes. Conversely, galaxies with the highest surface densities comprise a nearly homogeneous population with little or no ongoing star formation, while less dense galaxies exhibit high star formation rates and varying levels of dust obscuration. Both the sizes and surface densities of quiescent galaxies evolve strongly from z = 2-0; we parameterize this evolution for both populations with simple power-law functions and present best-fit parameters for comparison to future theoretical models. Higher-mass quiescent galaxies undergo faster structural evolution, consistent with previous results. Interestingly, star-forming galaxies' sizes and densities evolve at rates similar to those of quiescent galaxies. It is therefore possible that the same physical processes drive the structural evolution of both populations, suggesting that "dry mergers" may not be the sole culprit in this size evolution.},

abstract = {Clusters of galaxies, as the largest virialized systems in the Universe, are ideal laboratories to study the formation and evolution of cosmic structures. The luminous matter of clusters consists of galaxies and of an embedding intracluster medium (ICM), which has been heated to temperatures of tens of millions degrees, and thus is detected through its thermal emission in the soft X-ray regime. Most of the detailed knowledge of galaxy clusters has been obtained in recent years from the study of ICM through X-ray Astronomy. At the same time, radio observations have proved that the ICM is mixed with non-thermal components, i.e. highly relativistic particles and large-scale magnetic fields, detected through their synchrotron emission. The knowledge of the properties of these non-thermal ICM components has increased significantly, owing to sensitive radio images and to the development of theoretical models. Diffuse synchrotron radio emission in the central and peripheral cluster regions has been found in many clusters. Moreover large-scale magnetic fields appear to be present in all galaxy clusters, as derived from Rotation Measure (RM) studies. Non-thermal components are linked to the cluster X-ray properties, and to the cluster evolutionary stage, and are crucial for a comprehensive physical description of the intracluster medium. They play an important role in the cluster formation and evolution. We review here the observational properties of diffuse non-thermal sources detected in galaxy clusters: halos, relics and mini-halos. We discuss their classification and properties. We report published results up to date and obtain and discuss statistical properties. We present the properties of large-scale magnetic fields in clusters and in even larger structures: filaments connecting galaxy clusters. We summarize the current models of the origin of these cluster components, and outline the improvements that are expected in this area from future developments thanks to the new generation of radio telescopes.},

abstract = {New Chandra X-ray data and extensive optical spectroscopy, obtained with AAOmega on the 3.9 m Anglo-Australian Telescope, are used to study the complex merger taking place in the galaxy cluster Abell 2744. Combining our spectra with data from the literature provides a catalog of 1237 redshifts for extragalactic objects lying within 15' of the cluster center. From these, we confirm 343 cluster members projected within 3 Mpc of the cluster center. Combining positions and velocities, we identify two major substructures, corresponding to the remnants of two major subclusters. The new data are consistent with a post-core-passage, major merger taking place along an axis that is tilted well out of the plane of the sky, together with an interloping minor merger. Supporting this interpretation, the new X-ray data reveal enriched, low entropy gas from the core of the approaching, major subcluster, lying {\~{}}2' north of the cluster center, and a shock front to the southeast of the previously known bright, compact core associated with the receding subcluster. The X-ray morphology of the compact core is consistent with a Bullet-like cluster viewed from within {\~{}}45° of the merger axis. An X-ray peak {\~{}}3' northwest of the cluster center, with an associated cold front to the northeast and a trail of low entropy gas to the south, is interpreted as the remnant of an interloping minor merger taking place roughly in the plane of the sky. We infer approximate paths for the three merging components.},

abstract = {We analyze the spatial and velocity distributions of confirmed members in five massive clusters of galaxies at intermediate redshift (0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.9) to investigate the physical processes driving galaxy evolution. Based on spectral classifications derived from broad- and narrow-band photometry, we define four distinct galaxy populations representing different evolutionary stages: red sequence (RS) galaxies, blue cloud (BC) galaxies, green valley (GV) galaxies, and luminous compact blue galaxies (LCBGs). For each galaxy class, we derive the projected spatial and velocity distribution and characterize the degree of subclustering. We find that RS, BC, and GV galaxies in these clusters have similar velocity distributions, but that BC and GV galaxies tend to avoid the core of the two z{\~{}}0.55 clusters. GV galaxies exhibit subclustering properties similar to RS galaxies, but their radial velocity distribution is significantly platykurtic compared to the RS galaxies. The absence of GV galaxies in the cluster cores may explain their somewhat prolonged star-formation history. The LCBGs appear to have recently fallen into the cluster based on their larger velocity dispersion, absence from the cores of the clusters, and different radial velocity distribution than the RS galaxies. Both LCBG and BC galaxies show a high degree of subclustering on the smallest scales, leading us to conclude that star formation is likely triggered by galaxy-galaxy interactions during infall into the cluster.},

abstract = {We compare multi-wavelength star formation rate (SFR) indicators out to z {\~{}} 3 in the GOODS-South field. Our analysis uniquely combines U to 8 $\mu$m photometry from FIREWORKS, MIPS 24 $\mu$m and PACS 70, 100, and 160 $\mu$m photometry from the PEP, and H$\alpha$ spectroscopy from the SINS survey. We describe a set of conversions that lead to a continuity across SFR indicators. A luminosity-independent conversion from 24 $\mu$m to total infrared luminosity yields estimates of L IR that are in the median consistent with the L IR derived from PACS photometry, albeit with significant scatter. Dust correction methods perform well at low-to-intermediate levels of star formation. They fail to recover the total amount of star formation in systems with large SFRIR/SFRUV ratios, typically occuring at the highest SFRs (SFRUV + IR {\textgreater}{\~{}} 100 M sun yr-1) and redshifts (z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2.5) probed. Finally, we confirm that H$\alpha$-based SFRs at 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.6 are consistent with SFRSED and SFRUV + IR provided extra attenuation toward H II regions is taken into account (A V, neb = A V, continuum/0.44). With the cross-calibrated SFR indicators in hand, we perform a consistency check on the star formation histories inferred from spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. We compare the observed SFR-M relations and mass functions at a range of redshifts to equivalents that are computed by evolving lower redshift galaxies backward in time. We find evidence for underestimated stellar ages when no stringent constraints on formation epoch are applied in SED modeling. We demonstrate how resolved SED modeling, or alternatively deep UV data, may help to overcome this bias. The age bias is most severe for galaxies with young stellar populations and reduces toward older systems. Finally, our analysis suggests that SFHs typically vary on timescales that are long (at least several 100 Myr) compared to the galaxies' dynamical time.},

In addition to {\~{}}10 000 spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies, we use deep ugri-band imaging to estimate photometric redshifts and stellar masses, and then statistically subtract fore- and background sources using data from the COSMOS survey. We measure the galaxy number density and stellar mass density distributions in logarithmically spaced bins over 2 orders of magnitude in radial distance from the BCGs. For projected distances in the range 0.1 {\textless}R/R200{\textless} 2.0, we find that the stellar mass distribution is well-described by an NFW profile with a concentration of c = 2.03 ± 0.20. However, at smaller radii we measure a significant excess in the stellar mass in satellite galaxies of about 1011M⊙ per cluster, compared to these NFW profiles. We do obtain good fits to generalised NFW profiles with free inner slopes and to Einasto profiles. To examine how clusters assemble their stellar mass component over cosmic time, we compare this local sample to the GCLASS cluster sample at z {\~{}} 1, which represents the approximate progenitor sample of the low-z clusters. This allows for a direct comparison, which suggests that the central parts (R{\textless} 0.4 Mpc) of the stellar mass distributions of satellites in local galaxy clusters are already in place at z {\~{}} 1, and contain sufficient excess material for further BCG growth. Evolving towards z = 0, clusters appear to assemble their stellar mass primarily onto the outskirts, making them grow in an inside-out fashion.

The redshifts of the central galaxies in 29 of the X-ray brightest Abell and Zwicky clusters in the RASS have been measured using the Faint Object Spectrograph on the Isaac Newton Telescope. Approximately 40 percent of the central galaxy spectra obtained show strong optical line emission. In several cases, this emission is spectacular. The central cluster galaxy in Zwicky 3146 is the most luminous such galaxy in optical lines yet discovered, having an H -alpha luminosity approximately twice that of NGC 1275. The link between optical line emission and the presence of an excess of blue continuum flux in the spectra is reexamined; the two are found to be correlated. The spectral shape of the excess flux is well matched by B stars.},

@article{Mantz2015,
abstract = {This is the first in a series of papers studying the astrophysics and cosmology of massive, dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters. Here we present a new, automated method for identifying relaxed clusters based on their morphologies in X-ray imaging data. While broadly similar to others in the literature, the morphological quantities that we measure are specifically designed to provide a fair basis for comparison across a range of data quality and cluster redshifts, to be robust against missing data due to point source masks and gaps between detectors, and to avoid strong assumptions about the cosmological background and cluster masses. Based on three morphological indicators - symmetry, peakiness, and alignment - we develop the symmetry-peakiness-alignment (SPA) criterion for relaxation. This analysis was applied to a large sample of cluster observations from the Chandra and ROSAT archives. Of the 361 clusters which received the SPA treatment, 57 (16 per cent) were subsequently found to be relaxed according to our criterion. We compare our measurements to similar estimators in the literature, as well as projected ellipticity and other image measures, and comment on trends in the relaxed cluster fraction with redshift, temperature, and survey selection method. Code implementing our morphological analysis will be made available on the web (http://www.slac.stanford.edu/amantz/work/morph14/).},

abstract = {We present Very Large Telescope Infrared Spectrometer And Array Camera (ISAAC) near-infrared (NIR) spectrophotometric observations of 16 post-starburst galaxies aimed at constraining the debated influence of thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars on the spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies with stellar ages between 0.5 and 2 Gyr, hence critical for high-redshift studies. Post-starburst galaxies are characterized by negligible ongoing star formation and a SED dominated by the stellar population formed in a recent ({\textless}2 Gyr) burst. By selecting post-starburst galaxies with mean luminosity-weighted ages between 0.5 and 1.5 Gyr and a broad range of metallicities (based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical spectroscopy), we explore the parameter space over which the relative energy output of TP-AGB stars peaks. A key feature of the present study is that we target galaxies at z ≈ 0.2, so that two main spectral features of TP-AGB stars (C-molecule band-head drops at 1.41 and 1.77 $\mu$m, blended with strong telluric absorption features, hence hardly observable from the ground, for targets at z ≈ 0) move inside the H and K atmospheric windows and can be constrained for the first time to high accuracy. Our observations provide key constraints to stellar population synthesis models. Our main results are (i) the NIR regions around 1.41 and 1.77 $\mu$m (rest frame) are featureless for all galaxies in our sample over the whole range of relevant ages and metallicities at variance with the Maraston `TP-AGB heavy' models, which exhibit marked drops there, and (ii) no flux boosting is observed in the NIR. The optical-NIR SEDs of most of our post-starburst galaxies can be consistently reproduced with the 2003 version of the Bruzual {\&} Charlot models, using either simple stellar populations of corresponding light-weighted ages and metallicities or a more realistic burst plus an underlying old population containing up to approximately 60 per cent of the total stellar mass. In contrast, all combinations of this kind based on the Maraston models are unable to simultaneously reproduce the smoothness of the NIR spectra and the relatively blue optical-NIR colours in the observations. The data collected in this study appear to disfavour `TP-AGB heavy' models with respect to `TP-AGB light' ones.},

abstract = {The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical paradigm for the formation of structure in the Universe. Together with the theory of cosmic inflation, this model makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a novel framework for the quantitative physical interpretation of such surveys. This combines the largest simulation of the growth of dark matter structure ever carried out with new techniques for following the formation and evolution of the visible components. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with next generation surveys.},

@article{Boschin2004,
abstract = {We present the results of the dynamical analysis of the rich, hot, and X-ray very luminous galaxy cluster A2219, containing a powerful diffuse radio-halo. Our analysis is based on new redshift data for 27 galaxies in the cluster region, measured from spectra obtained at the TNG, with the addition of other 105 galaxies recovered from reduction of CFHT archive data in a cluster region of ˜5 arcmin radius (˜ 0.8 h-1 Mpc ; at the cluster distance) centered on the cD galaxy. The investigation of the dynamical status is also performed using X-ray data stored in the Chandra archive. Further, valuable information comes from other bands - optical photometric, infrared, and radio data - which are analyzed and/or discussed, too. We find that A2219 appears as a peak in the velocity space at z=0.225, and select 113 cluster members. We compute a high value for the line-of-sight velocity dispersion, $\sigma$v= 1438+109-86 km s-1, consistent with the high average X-ray temperature of 10.3 keV. If dynamical equilibrium is assumed, the virial theorem leads to M˜2.8× 1015 M⊙ ;sun for the global mass within the virial region. However, further investigation based on both optical and X-ray data shows significant signs of a young dynamical status. In fact, we find strong evidence for the elongation of the cluster in the SE-NW direction coupled with a significant velocity gradient, as well as for the presence of substructure both in optical data and X-ray data. Moreover, we point out the presence of several active galaxies. We discuss the results of our multi-wavelength investigation suggesting a complex merging scenario where the main, original structure is subject to an ongoing merger with a few clumps aligned in a filament in the foreground oriented in an oblique direction with respect to the line-of-sight. Our conclusion supports the view of the connection between extended radio emission and merging phenomena in galaxy clusters. Based on observations made on the island of La Palma with the Italian Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) operated by the Centro Galileo Galilei of the INAF (Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica) and with the 1.0 m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope (JKT) operated by the Isaac Newton Group at the Spanish Observatorio de Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias.

abstract = {Distant galaxies show correlations between their current star-formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses, implying that their star-formation histories (SFHs) are highly similar. Moreover, observations show that the UV luminosities and stellar masses grow from z=8 to 3, implying that the SFRs increase with time. We compare the cosmologically averaged evolution in galaxies at 3 {\textless} z {\textless} 8 at constant comoving number density, n = 2 x 10{\^{}}-4 Mpc{\^{}}-3. This allows us to study the evolution of stellar mass and star formation in the galaxy predecessors and descendants in ways not possible using galaxies selected at constant stellar mass or SFR, quantities that evolve strongly in time. We show that the average SFH of these galaxies increase smoothly from z=8 to 3 as SFR {\~{}} t{\^{}}alpha with alpha = 1.7 +/- 0.2. This conflicts with assumptions that the SFR is either constant or declines exponentially in time. We show that the stellar mass growth in these galaxies is consistent with this derived SFH. This provides evidence that the slope of the high-mass end of the IMF is approximately Salpeter unless the duty cycle of star formation is much less than unity. We argue that these relations follow from gas accretion (either through accretion or delivered by mergers) coupled with galaxy disk growth under the assumption that the SFR depends on the local gas surface density. This predicts that gas fractions decrease from z=8 to 3 on average as f{\_}gas {\~{}} (1+z){\^{}}0.9 for galaxies with this number density. The implied galaxy gas accretion rates at z {\textgreater} 4 are as fast and may even exceed the SFR: this is the "gas accretion epoch". At z {\textless} 4 the SFR overtakes the implied gas accretion rate, indicating a period where galaxies consume gas faster than it is acquired. At z {\textless} 3, galaxies with this number density depart from these relations implying that star formation and gas accretion are slowed at later times.},

In light of these results, the interpretation of isolated galaxy pairs as binaries whose dynamics is dominated by the two-body force is questioned.

abstract = {We use measurements from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster survey in combination with X-ray measurements to constrain cosmological parameters. We present a statistical method that fits for the scaling relations of the SZ and X-ray cluster observables with mass while jointly fitting for cosmology. The method is generalizable to multiple cluster observables, and self-consistently accounts for the effects of the cluster selection and uncertainties in cluster mass calibration on the derived cosmological constraints. We apply this method to a data set consisting of an SZ-selected catalog of 18 galaxy clusters at z {\textgreater} 0.3 from the first 178 deg2 of the 2500 deg2 SPT-SZ survey, with 14 clusters having X-ray observations from either Chandra or XMM. Assuming a spatially flat LCDM cosmological model, we find the SPT cluster sample constrain sigma{\_}8 (Omega{\_}m/0.25){\^{}}0.30 = 0.785 +- 0.037. In combination with measurements of the CMB power spectrum from the SPT and the seven-year WMAP data, the SPT cluster sample constrain sigma{\_}8 = 0.795 +- 0.016 and Omega{\_}m = 0.255 +- 0.016, a factor of 1.5 improvement on each parameter over the CMB data alone. We consider several extensions beyond the LCDM model by including the following as free parameters: the dark energy equation of state (w), the sum of the neutrino masses (sum mnu), the effective number of relativistic species (Neff), and a primordial non-Gaussianity (fNL). We find that adding the SPT cluster data significantly improves the constraints on w and sum mnu beyond those found when using measurements of the CMB, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the Hubble constant. Considering each extension independently, we best constrain w=-0.973 +- 0.063 and the sum of neutrino masses sum mnu {\textless} 0.28 eV at 95{\%} confidence, a factor of 1.25 and 1.4 improvement, respectively, over the constraints without clusters.

abstract = {We report on the first deep X-ray survey with the XMM-Newton observatory during the performance verification phase. The field of the Lockman Hole, one of the best studied sky areas over a very wide range of wavelengths, has been observed. A total of {\~{}}100 ksec good exposure time has been accumulated. Combining the images of the European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) detectors we reach a flux limit of 0.31, 1.4 and 2.4 X 10{\^{}}{\{}-15{\}} erg cm{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}} s{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}, respectively in the 0.5-2, 2-10, and 5-10 keV band. Within an off-axis angle of 10 arcmin we detect 148, 112 and 61 sources, respectively. The log(N)-log(S) relation in the three bands is compared with previous results. In particular in the 5-10 keV band these observations present the deepest X-ray survey ever, about a factor 20 more sensitive than the previous BeppoSAX observations. Using X-ray spectral diagnostics and the set of previously known, spectroscopically identified ROSAT sources in the field, the new sources can be classified. XMM-Newton detects a significant number ({\~{}}40{\%}) of X-ray sources with hard, probably intrinsically absorbed X-ray spectra, confirming a prediction of the population synthesis models for the X-ray background.},

abstract = {Aims: We aim to compute the mass and velocity anisotropy profiles of Abell 2142 and, from there, the pseudo phase-space density profile Q(r) and the density slope - velocity anisotropy $\beta$ - $\gamma$ relation, and then to compare them with theoretical expectations. Methods: The mass profiles were obtained by using three techniques based on member galaxy kinematics, namely the caustic method, the method of dispersion-kurtosis, and MAMPOSSt. Through the inversion of the Jeans equation, it was possible to compute the velocity anisotropy profiles. Results: The mass profiles, as well as the virial values of mass and radius, computed with the different techniques agree with one another and with the estimates coming from X-ray and weak lensing studies. A combined mass profile is obtained by averaging the lensing, X-ray, and kinematics determinations. The cluster mass profile is well fitted by an NFW profile with c = 4.0 ± 0.5. The population of red and blue galaxies appear to have a different velocity anisotropy configuration, since red galaxies are almost isotropic, while blue galaxies are radially anisotropic, with a weak dependence on radius. The Q(r) profile for the red galaxy population agrees with the theoretical results found in cosmological simulations, suggesting that any bias, relative to the dark matter particles, in velocity dispersion of the red component is independent of radius. The $\beta$ - $\gamma$ relation for red galaxies matches the theoretical relation only in the inner region. The deviations might be due to the use of galaxies as tracers of the gravitational potential, unlike the non-collisional tracer used in the theoretical relation.},

abstract = {We use semi-analytic modelling of the galaxy-cluster population and its strong lensing efficiency to explore how the expected abundance of large gravitational arcs on the sky depends on {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8{\$}. Our models take all effects into account that have been shown to affect strong cluster lensing substantially, in particular cluster asymmetry, substructure, merging, and variations in the central density concentrations. We show that the optical depth for long and thin arcs increases by approximately one order of magnitude when {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8{\$} increases from 0.7 to 0.9, owing to a constructive combination of several effects. Models with high {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8{\$} are also several orders of magnitude more efficient in producing arcs at intermediate and high redshifts. Finally, we use realistic source number counts to quantitatively predict the total number of arcs brighter than several magnitude limits in the R and I bands. We confirm that, while {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8\backslashsim0.9{\$} may come close to the known abundance of arcs, even {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8\backslashsim0.8{\$} falls short by almost an order of magnitude in reproducing known counts. We conclude that, should {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8\backslashsim0.8{\$} be confirmed, we would fail to understand the strong-lensing efficiency of the galaxy cluster population, and in particular the abundance of arcs in high-redshift clusters. We argue that early-dark energy or non-Gaussian density fluctuations may indicate one way out of this problem.},

The total mass range of the combined sample is {\~{}}(1012-5) × 1014 M ⊙. Only nine optical systems are associable with X-ray systems. We discuss the confusion inherent in the matching of both galaxies to extended X-ray emission and of X-ray emission to already identified optical systems. Extensive spectroscopy has been obtained and the resultant redshift catalog and group membership are provided here. X-ray, dynamical, and total stellar masses of the groups are also derived and presented. We explore the effects of utilizing different centers and applying three different kinds of radial cut to our systems: a constant cut of 1 Mpc and two r 200 cuts, one based on the velocity dispersion of the system and the other on the X-ray emission. We find that an X-ray-based r 200 results in less scatter in scaling relations and less dynamical complexity as evidenced by results of the Anderson-Darling and Dressler-Schectman tests, indicating that this radius tends to isolate the virialized part of the system. The constant and velocity dispersion based cuts can overestimate membership and can work to inflate velocity dispersion and dynamical and stellar mass. We find LX -$\sigma$ and M stellar-LX scaling relations for X-ray and optically selected systems are not dissimilar. The mean fraction of mass found in stars, excluding intracluster light, for our systems is {\~{}}0.014 with a logarithmic standard deviation of 0.398 dex. We also define and investigate a sample of groups which are X-ray underluminous given the total group stellar mass. For these systems the fraction of stellar mass contributed by the most massive galaxy is typically lower than that found for the total population of groups implying that there may be less intragroup medium contributed from the most massive member in these systems. Eighty percent of 15 underluminous groups have less than 40{\%} of their stellar mass in the most massive galaxy which happens in less than 1{\%} of cases with samples matched in stellar mass, taken from the combined group catalog.},

abstract = {Template fits to observed galaxy fluxes allow calculation of K-corrections and conversions among observations of galaxies at various wavelengths. We present a method for creating model-based template sets given a set of heterogeneous photometric and spectroscopic galaxy data. Our technique, non-negative matrix factorization, is akin to principle component analysis (PCA), except that it is constrained to produce nonnegative templates, it can use a basis set of models (rather than the delta function basis of PCA), and it naturally handles uncertainties, missing data, and heterogeneous data (including broad-band fluxes at various redshifts). The particular implementation we present here is suitable for ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared observations in the redshift range 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5. Since we base our templates on stellar population synthesis models, the results are intepretable in terms of approximate stellar masses and star-formation histories. We present templates fit with this method to data from GALEX, Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy and photometry, the Two-Micron All Sky Survey, the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. In addition, we present software for using such data to estimate K-corrections and stellar masses.},

abstract = {Galaxy clusters, the largest clearly defined objects in our Universe, are ideal laboratories to study in detail the cosmic evolution of the intergalactic intracluster medium (ICM) and the cluster galaxy population. For the ICM, which is heated to X-ray radiating temperatures, X-ray spectroscopy is the most important tool to obtain insight into the structure and astrophysics of galaxy clusters. The ICM is also the hottest plasma that can be well studied under thermal equilibrium conditions. In this review we recall the basic principles of the interpretation of X-ray spectra from a hot, tenuous plasma and we illustrate the wide range of scientific applications of X-ray spectroscopy. The determination of galaxy cluster masses, the most important prerequisite for using clusters in cosmological studies, rest crucially on a precise spectroscopic determination of the ICM temperature distribution. The study of the thermal structure of the ICM provides a very interesting fossil record of the energy release during galaxy formation and evolution, giving important constraints on galaxy formation models. The temperature and pressure distribution of the ICM gives us important insight into the process of galaxy cluster merging and the dissipation of the merger energy in form of turbulent motion. Cooling cores in the centers of about half of the cluster population are interesting laboratories to investigate the interplay between gas cooling, star- and black hole formation and energy feedback, which is diagnosed by means of X-ray spectroscopy. The element abundances deduced from X-ray spectra of the ICM provide a cosmic history record of the contribution of different supernovae to the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements and their spatial distribution partly reflects important transport processes in the ICM. Some discussion of plasma diagnostics for conditions out of thermal equilibrium and an outlook on the future prospects of X-ray spectroscopic cluster studies complete our review.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that it is possible to measure metallicity from the SDSS five-band photometry to better than 0.1 dex using supervised machine learning algorithms. Using spectroscopic estimates of metallicity as ground truth, we build, optimize and train several estimators to predict metallicity. We use the observed photometry, as well as derived quantities such as stellar mass and photometric redshift, as features, and we build two sample data sets at median redshifts of 0.103 and 0.218 and median r-band magnitude of 17.5 and 18.3 respectively. We find that ensemble methods, such as Random Forests of Trees and Extremely Randomized Trees, and Support Vector Machines all perform comparably well and can measure metallicity with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.081 and 0.090 for the two data sets when all objects are included. The fraction of outliers (objects for which the difference between true and predicted metallicity is larger than 0.2 dex) is only 2.2 and 3.9{\%} respectively, and the RMSE decreases to 0.068 and 0.069 if those objects are excluded. Because of the ability of these algorithms to capture complex relationships between data and target, our technique performs better than previously proposed methods that sought to fit metallicity using an analytic fitting formula, and has 3x more constraining power than SED fitting-based methods. Additionally, this method is extremely forgiving of contamination in the training set, thus requiring minimal data cleaning, and is very flexible, particularly in regard to combining photometric data with other constraints (for example, measurements of emission line fluxes). We find that our technique can be used with very satisfactory results for training sample sizes of just a few hundred objects. All the routines to reproduce our results and apply them to other data sets are made available.},

abstract = {Cluster mass profiles are tests of models of structure formation. Only two current observational methods of determining the mass profile, gravitational lensing and the caustic technique, are independent of the assumption of dynamical equilibrium. Both techniques enable determination of the extended mass profile at radii beyond the virial radius. For 19 clusters, we compare the mass profile based on the caustic technique with weak lensing measurements taken from the literature. This comparison offers a test of systematic issues in both techniques. Around the virial radius, the two methods of mass estimation agree to within about 30{\%}, consistent with the expected errors in the individual techniques. At small radii, the caustic technique overestimates the mass as expected from numerical simulations. The ratio between the lensing profile and the caustic mass profile at these radii suggests that the weak lensing profiles are a good representation of the true mass profile. At radii larger than the virial radius, the lensing mass profile exceeds the caustic mass profile possibly as a result of contamination of the lensing profile by large-scale structures within the lensing kernel. We highlight the case of the closely neighboring clusters MS0906+11 and A750 to illustrate the potential seriousness of contamination of the the weak lensing signal by unrelated structures.},

abstract = {Aims: We present spectroscopic observations of galaxies in 15 survey fields as part of the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS). We determine the redshifts and velocity dispersions of the galaxy clusters located in these fields, and we test for possible substructure in the clusters. Methods: We obtained multi-object mask spectroscopy using the FORS2 instrument at the VLT. We reduced the data with particular attention to the sky subtraction. We implemented the method of Kelson for performing sky subtraction prior to any rebinning/interpolation of the data. From the measured galaxy redshifts, we determine cluster velocity dispersions using the biweight estimator and test for possible substructure in the clusters using the Dressler-Shectman test. Results: The method of subtracting the sky prior to any rebinning/interpolation of the data delivers photon-noise-limited results, whereas the traditional method of subtracting the sky after the data have been rebinned/interpolated results in substantially larger noise for spectra from tilted slits. Redshifts for individual galaxies are presented and redshifts and velocity dispersions are presented for 21 galaxy clusters. For the 9 clusters with at least 20 spectroscopically confirmed members, we present the statistical significance of the presence of substructure obtained from the Dressler-Shectman test, and substructure is detected in two of the clusters. Conclusions: Together with data from our previous paper, spectroscopy and spectroscopic velocity dispersions are now available for 26 EDisCS clusters with redshifts in the range 0.40-0.96 and velocity dispersions in the range 166 km s-1-1080 km s-1.

abstract = {We present a general statistical framework for describing the effect of sample variance in the number counts of virialized objects and examine its effect on cosmological parameter estimation. Specifically, we consider effects of sample variance on the power spectrum normalization and properties of dark energy extracted from current and future local and high-redshift samples of clusters. We show that for future surveys that probe ever lower cluster masses and temperatures, sample variance is generally comparable to or greater than shot noise and thus cannot be neglected in deriving precision cosmological constraints. For example, sample variance is usually more important than shot variance in constraints on the equation of state of the dark energy from z {\textless} 1 clusters. Although we found that effects of sample variance on the sigma{\_}8-Omega{\_}m constraints from the current flux and temperature limited X-ray surveys are not significant, they may be important for future studies utilizing the shape of the temperature function to break the sigma{\_}8-Omega{\_}m degeneracy. We also present numerical tests clarifying the definition of cluster mass employed in cosmological modelling and accurate fitting formula for the conversion between different definitions of halo mass (e.g., virial vs. fixed overdensity).},

The 2D projected map for the distribution of the clusters members is introduced using the 2D adaptive kernel method to get the clusters centers. The cumulative surface number density profile for each cluster is fitted well with the generalized King model. The core radii of the clusters' sample are found to vary from 0.18 Mpc {\$}\backslashmbox{\{}h{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} (A1459) to 0.47 Mpc {\$}\backslashmbox{\{}h{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} (A2670) with mean value of 0.295 Mpc {\$}\backslashmbox{\{}h{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}. The infall velocity profile is determined using two different models, Yahil approximation and Praton model. Yahil approximation is matched with the distribution of galaxies only in the outskirts (infall regions) of many clusters of the sample, while it is not matched with the distribution within the inner core of the clusters. Both Yahil approximation and Praton model are matched together in the infall region for about 9 clusters in the sample but they are completely unmatched for the clusters characterized by high central density. For these cluster, Yahil approximation is not matched with the distribution of galaxies, while Praton model can describe well the infall pattern of such clusters.},

abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the European Space Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page at http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia.},

abstract = {We present a technique for estimating the mass in the outskirts of galaxy clusters where the usual assumption of dynamical equilibrium is not valid. The method assumes that clusters form through hierarchical clustering and requires only galaxy redshifts and positions on the sky. We apply the method to dissipationless cosmological N-body simulations where galaxies form and evolve according to semi-analytic modelling. The method recovers the actual cluster mass profile within a factor of 2 to several megaparsecs from the cluster centre. This error originates from projection effects, sparse sampling, and contamination by foreground and background galaxies. In the absence of velocity biases, this method can provide an estimate of the mass-to-light ratio on scales {\~{}}1-10h-1Mpc where this quantity is still poorly known.},

Based on publicly available griz optical images and XMM-Newton and ROSAT X-ray observations we analyse the physical properties of these clusters and obtain photometric redshifts, luminosities, richness and mass estimates. Each cluster contains a central elliptical whose luminosity is consistent with SDSS cluster studies.

abstract = {We present the large-scale correlation function measured from a spectroscopic sample of 46,748 luminous red galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The survey region covers 0.72 h-3 Gpc3 over 3816 deg2 and 0.16{\textless}z{\textless}0.47, making it the best sample yet for the study of large-scale structure. We find a well-detected peak in the correlation function at 100 h-1 Mpc separation that is an excellent match to the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This detection demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between z{\~{}}1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4{\%} fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to z=0.35 to 5{\%} accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation function, we measure the matter density $\Omega$mh2 to 8{\%} and find agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB acoustic scale, we find $\Omega$m=0.273+/-0.025+0.123(1+w0)+0.137$\Omega$K. Including the CMB acoustic scale, we find that the spatial curvature is $\Omega$K=-0.010+/-0.009 if the dark energy is a cosmological constant. More generally, our results provide a measurement of cosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy, based on a geometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave background anisotropies. The standard cosmological model convincingly passes these new and robust tests of its fundamental properties.},

@article{Hearin2013,
abstract = {We investigate the potential to improve optical tracers of cluster mass by exploiting measurements of the magnitude gap, m12, defined as the difference between the r-band absolute magnitudes of the two brightest cluster members. We find that in a mock sample of galaxy groups and clusters constructed from the Bolshoi simulation, the scatter about the mass-richness relation decreases by ˜15-20 per cent when magnitude gap information is included. A similar trend is evident in a volume-limited, spectroscopic sample of galaxy groups observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that SDSS groups with small magnitude gaps are richer than large-gap groups at fixed values of the one-dimensional velocity dispersion among group members $\sigma$v, which we use as a mass proxy. We demonstrate explicitly that m12 contains information about cluster mass that supplements the information provided by group richness and the luminosity of the brightest cluster galaxy, LBCG. In so doing, we show that the luminosities of the members of a group with richness N are inconsistent with the distribution of luminosities that results from N random draws from the global galaxy luminosity function. As the cosmological constraining power of galaxy clusters is limited by the precision in cluster mass determination, our findings suggest a new way to improve the cosmological constraints derived from galaxy clusters.},

abstract = {The Millennium Run is the largest simulation of the formation of structure within the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM cosmogony so far carried out. It uses {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}{\$} particles to follow the dark matter distribution in a cubic region 500{\$}h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}Mpc on a side, and has a spatial resolution of 5 {\$}h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}kpc. Application of simplified modelling techniques to the stored output of this calculation allows the formation and evolution of the {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}7{\$} galaxies more luminous than the Small Magellanic Cloud to be simulated for a variety of assumptions about the detailed physics involved. As part of the activities of the German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory we have used a relational database to store the detailed assembly histories both of all the haloes and subhaloes resolved by the simulation, and of all the galaxies that form within these structures for two independent models of the galaxy formation physics. We have created web applications that allow users to query these databases remotely using the standard Structured Query Language (SQL). This allows easy access to all properties of the galaxies and halos, as well as to the spatial and temporal relations between them and their environment. Information is output in table format compatible with standard Virtual Observatory tools and protocols. With this announcement we are making these structures fully accessible to all users. Interested scientists can learn SQL, gain familiarity with the database design and test queries on a small, openly accessible version of the Millennium Run (with volume 1/512 that of the full simulation). They can then request accounts to run similar queries on the databases for the full simulations.},

abstract = {We provide flux- and volume-limited galaxy group and cluster catalogues based on the spectroscopic sample of the galaxies of SDSS data release 10. We used a modified friends-of-friends method with a variable linking length in the transverse and radial directions to identify as many realistic groups as possible. The flux-limited catalogue incorporates galaxies down to mr = 17.77 mag. It includes 588 193 galaxies and 82 458 groups. The volume-limited catalogues are complete for absolute magnitudes down to Mr,lim = -18.0, -18.5, -19.0, -19.5, -20.0, -20.5, and -21.0; the completeness is achieved within different spatial volumes. Our analysis shows that flux- and volume-limited group samples are well compatible, especially for the larger groups/clusters. Dynamical mass estimates based on radial velocity dispersions and group extent in the sky were added to the extracted groups.

abstract = {We present improved methods for using stars found in astronomical exposures to calibrate both star and galaxy colors as well as to adjust the instrument flat field. By developing a spectroscopic model for the SDSS stellar locus in color-color space, synthesizing an expected stellar locus, and simultaneously solving for all unknown zeropoints when fitting to the instrumental locus, we increase the calibration accuracy of stellar locus matching. We also use a new combined technique to estimate improved flat-field models for the Subaru SuprimeCam camera, forming `star flats' based on the magnitudes of stars observed in multiple positions or through comparison with available SDSS magnitudes. These techniques yield galaxy magnitudes with reliable color calibration ({\textless} 0.01 - 0.02 mag accuracy) that enable us to estimate photometric redshift probability distributions without spectroscopic training samples. We test the accuracy of our photometric redshifts using spectroscopic redshifts z{\_}s for {\~{}}5000 galaxies in 27 cluster fields with at least five bands of photometry, as well as galaxies in the COSMOS field, finding sigma((z{\_}p - z{\_}s)/(1 + z{\_}s)) {\~{}} 0.03 for the most probable redshift z{\_}p. We show that the full posterior probability distributions for the redshifts of galaxies with five-band photometry exhibit good agreement with redshifts estimated from thirty-band photometry in the COSMOS field. The growth of shear with increasing distance behind each galaxy cluster shows the expected redshift-distance relation for a flat Lambda-CDM cosmology. Photometric redshifts and calibrated colors are used in subsequent papers to measure the masses of 51 galaxy clusters from their weak gravitational shear. We make our Python code for stellar locus matching available at http://big-macs-calibrate.googlecode.com; the code requires only a catalog and filter functions.},

abstract = {[Abridged] We present a catalog of 68 galaxy clusters, of which 19 are new discoveries, detected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZ) at 148 GHz in the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) survey of 504 square degrees on the celestial equator. A subsample of 48 clusters within the 270 square degree region overlapping SDSS Stripe 82 is estimated to be 90{\%} complete for M{\_}500c {\textgreater} 4.5e14 Msun and 0.15 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.8. While matched filters are used to detect the clusters, the sample is studied further through a "Profile Based Amplitude Analysis" using a single filter at a fixed $\backslash$theta{\_}500 = 5.9' angular scale. This new approach takes advantage of the "Universal Pressure Profile" (UPP) to fix the relationship between the cluster characteristic size (R{\_}500) and the integrated Compton parameter (Y{\_}500). The UPP scalings are found to be nearly identical to an adiabatic model, while a model incorporating non-thermal pressure better matches dynamical mass measurements and masses from the South Pole Telescope. A high signal to noise ratio subsample of 15 ACT clusters is used to obtain cosmological constraints. We first confirm that constraints from SZ data are limited by uncertainty in the scaling relation parameters rather than sample size or measurement uncertainty. We next add in seven clusters from the ACT Southern survey, including their dynamical mass measurements based on galaxy velocity dispersions. In combination with WMAP7 these data simultaneously constrain the scaling relation and cosmological parameters, yielding $\backslash$sigma{\_}8 = 0.829 $\backslash$pm 0.024 and $\backslash$Omega{\_}m = 0.292 $\backslash$pm 0.025. The results include marginalization over a 15{\%} bias in dynamical mass relative to the true halo mass. In an extension to LCDM that incorporates non-zero neutrino mass density, we combine our data with WMAP7+BAO+Hubble constant measurements to constrain $\backslash$Sigma m{\_}$\backslash$nu {\textless} 0.29 eV (95{\%} C.

abstract = {We present the first robust measurement of the high redshift mass-metallicity (MZ) relation at 10{\^{}}{\{}8{\}}{\textless} M/M{\_}{\{}$\backslash$sun{\}} {\textless} 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}, obtained by stacking spectra of 83 emission-line galaxies with secure redshifts between 1.3 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.3. For these redshifts, infrared grism spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 is sensitive to the R23 metallicity diagnostic: ([OII]3726,3729 + [OIII] 4959,5007)/H$\backslash$beta. Using spectra stacked in four mass quartiles, we find a MZ relation that declines significantly with decreasing mass, extending from 12+log(O/H) = 8.8 at M=10{\^{}}{\{}9.8{\}} M{\_}{\{}$\backslash$sun{\}} to 12+log(O/H)= 8.2 at M=10{\^{}}{\{}8.2{\}} M{\_}{\{}$\backslash$sun{\}}. After correcting for systematic offsets between metallicity indicators, we compare our MZ relation to measurements from the stacked spectra of galaxies with M{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}9.5{\}} M{\_}{\{}$\backslash$sun{\}} and z{\~{}}2.3. Within the statistical uncertainties, our MZ relation agrees with the z{\~{}}2.3 result, particularly since our somewhat higher metallicities (by around 0.1 dex) are qualitatively consistent with the lower mean redshift z=1.76 of our sample. For the masses probed by our data, the MZ relation shows a steep slope which is suggestive of feedback from energy-driven winds, and a cosmological downsizing evolution where high mass galaxies reach the local MZ relation at earlier times. In addition, we show that our sample falls on an extrapolation of the star-forming main sequence (the SFR-M{\_}{\{}*{\}} relation) at this redshift. This result indicates that grism emission-line selected samples do not have preferentially high SFRs. Finally, we report no evidence for evolution of the mass-metallicity-SFR plane; our stack-averaged measurements show excellent agreement with the local relation.},

@article{Ferreras2011,
abstract = {(Abridged) We present here a detailed analysis of the star formation history (SFH) of FW4871, a massive galaxy at z=1.893+-0.002. We compare rest-frame optical and NUV slitless grism spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope with a large set of composite stellar populations to constrain the underlying star formation history. Even though the morphology features prominent tidal tails, indicative of a recent merger, there is no sign of on-going star formation within an aperture encircling one effective radius, which corresponds to a physical extent of 2.6 kpc. A model assuming truncation of an otherwise constant SFH gives a formation epoch zF{\~{}}10, with a truncation after 2.7 Gyr, giving a mass-weighted age of 1.5 Gyr and a stellar mass of 0.8-3E11Msun, implying star formation rates of 30-110 Msun/yr. A more complex model including a recent burst of star formation places the age of the youngest component at 145 Myr, with a mass contribution lower than 20{\%}, and a maximum amount of dust reddening of E(B-V){\textless}0.4 mag (95{\%} confidence levels). This low level of dust reddening is consistent with the low emission observed at 24 micron, corresponding to rest-frame 8 micron, where PAH emission should contribute significantly if a strong formation episode were present. The colour profile of FW4871 does not suggest a significant radial trend in the properties of the stellar populations out to 3Re. We suggest that the recent merger that formed FW4871 is responsible for the quenching of its star formation.},

abstract = {We investigate the emission-line properties of galaxies with red rest-frame colors (compared to the g-r color bimodality) using spectra from SDSS DR4. Emission lines are detected in more than half of the red galaxies. We focus on the relationship between two emission lines commonly used as star formation rate indicators: H$\alpha$ and [O II] $\lambda$3727. There is a strong bimodality in [O II]/H$\alpha$ ratio in the SDSS sample that closely corresponds to the bimodality in rest-frame color. Nearly all of the line-emitting red galaxies have line ratios typical of various types of AGNs-most commonly LINERs, a small fraction of transition objects, and, more rarely, Seyferts. Only {\~{}}6{\%} of red galaxies display star-forming line ratios. A straight line in the [O II]-H$\alpha$ EW diagram separates LINER-like galaxies from other categories. Quiescent galaxies with no detectable emission lines and LINER-like galaxies combine to form a single, tight red sequence in color-magnitude-concentration space. [O II] EWs in LINER- and AGN-like galaxies can be as large as those in star-forming galaxies. Thus, unless objects with AGN/LINER-like line ratios are excluded, [O II] emission cannot be used directly as a proxy for star formation rate; this is a particular issue for red galaxies. Lack of [O II] emission is generally used to indicate a lack of star formation when poststarburst galaxies are selected at high redshift. Our results imply, however, that these samples have been cut on AGN properties, as well as star formation, and therefore may provide seriously incomplete sets of poststarburst galaxies. Furthermore, poststarburst galaxies identified in SDSS by requiring minimal H$\alpha$ EW generally exhibit weak but nonzero line emission with ratios typical of AGNs; few of them show residual star formation. This suggests that most poststarburst galaxies may harbor AGNs/LINERs.},

The catalogue contains 1227 entries, making it over six times the size of the Planck Early SZ (ESZ) sample and the largest SZ-selected catalogue to date. It contains 861 confirmed clusters, of which 178 have been confirmed as clusters, mostly through follow-up observations, and a further 683 are previously-known clusters. The remaining 366 have the status of cluster candidates, and we divide them into three classes according to the quality of evidence that they are likely to be true clusters. The Planck SZ catalogue is the deepest all-sky cluster catalogue, with redshifts up to about one, and spans the broadest cluster mass range from (0.1 to 1.6) 10{\^{}}{\{}15{\}}Msun. Confirmation of cluster candidates through comparison with existing surveys or cluster catalogues is extensively described, as is the statistical characterization of the catalogue in terms of completeness and statistical reliability. The outputs of the validation process are provided as additional information. This gives, in particular, an ensemble of 813 cluster redshifts, and for all these Planck clusters we also include a mass estimated from a newly-proposed SZ-mass proxy. A refined measure of the SZ Compton parameter for the clusters with X-ray counter-parts is provided, as is an X-ray flux for all the Planck clusters not previously detected in X-ray surveys.},

Cluster membership selection is based on nonparametric methods. In the estimate of galaxy velocity dispersion we consider the effects of possible velocity anisotropies in galaxy orbits, the infall of late-type galaxies, and velocity gradients. The dynamical uncertainties due to the presence of substructures are also taken into account. Our cumulative distribution agrees with previous distributions within their completness in velocity dispersion ( {\textgreater} 800 km/s). We estimate that our distributions is complete for at least a dispersion greater than 650 km/s. In this completeness range a power law fit is in fair agreement with results coming from the X-ray temperature distributions.},

The radio sources within these clusters are driven by active galactic nuclei, and our cluster samples include clusters with bent, and straight, double-lobed radio sources. We also included a single-radio-component comparison sample. We examine these galaxy clusters for evidence of optical substructure, testing the possibility that bent double-lobed radio sources are formed as a result of large-scale cluster mergers. We use a suite of substructure analysis tools to determine the location and extent of substructure visible in the optical distribution of cluster galaxies, and compare the rates of substructure in clusters with different types of radio sources. We found no preference for significant substructure in clusters hosting bent double-lobed radio sources compared to those with other types of radio sources.},

@article{Akritas1996,
abstract = {Two new methods are proposed for linear regression analysis for data with measurement errors. Both methods are designed to accommodate intrinsic scatter in addition to measurement errors. The first method is a direct extension of the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator to allow for measurement errors. It is quite general in that (1) it allows for measurement errors on both variables (2) it permits the measurement errors for the two variables to be dependent, (3) it permits the magnitudes of the measurement errors to depend on the measurements, and (4) other "symmetric" lines such as the bisector and the orthogonal regression can be constructed. We refer to this method as BCES estimators (for bivariate correlated errors and intrinsic scatter). The second method is a weighted least squares (WLS) estimator, which applies only for the case in which the "independent" variable is measured without error and the magnitudes of the measurement errors on the "dependent" variable are independent of the measurements. Several applications are made to extragalactic astronomy: the BCES method, when applied to data describing the color-luminosity relations for field galaxies, yields significantly different slopes than OLS and other estimators used in the literature. Simulations with artificial data sets are used to evaluate the small sample performance of the estimators. Not surprisingly, the least-biased results are obtained when color is treated as the dependent variable. The Tully-Fisher relation is another example for which the BCES method should be used because errors in luminosity and velocity are correlated because of inclination corrections. We also find, via simulations, that the WLS method is by far the best method for the Tolman surface-brightness test, producing the smallest variance in slope by an order of magnitude. Moreover, with WLS it is not necessary to "reduce" galaxies to a fiducial surface-brightness, since this model incorporates intrinsic scatter.},

@article{Cole2000,
abstract = {We describe the GALFORM semi-analytic model for calculating the formation and evolution of galaxies in hierarchical clustering cosmologies. It improves upon, and extends, the earlier scheme developed by Cole et al. The model employs a new Monte Carlo algorithm to follow the merging evolution of dark matter haloes with arbitrary mass resolution. It incorporates realistic descriptions of the density profiles of dark matter haloes and the gas they contain; it follows the chemical evolution of gas and stars, and the associated production of dust; and it includes a detailed calculation of the sizes of discs and spheroids. Wherever possible, our prescriptions for modelling individual physical processes are based on results of numerical simulations. They require a number of adjustable parameters, which we fix by reference to a small subset of local galaxy data. This results in a fully specified model of galaxy formation which can be tested against other data. We apply our methods to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology f12(M1,M2) dM1 [1/√2$\pi$] [($\delta$c1 - $\delta$c2)/ ($\sigma$21 - $\sigma$22)3/2] x exp [-($\delta$c1 - $\delta$c2)2/ 2($\sigma$22)] [d$\sigma$21/dM1] d M1 ($\Omega$0=0.3) (df12)/(dt1 t1t2) dM1 dt1 [1/√(2$\pi$)] [1 / $\sigma$21 - $\sigma$22)3/2] [d$\delta$c1/dt1] [d$\sigma$21/dM1] dM1 dt1 $\Lambda$0=0.7),-{\textgreater} and find good agreement with a wide range of properties of the local galaxy population: the B- and K-band luminosity functions, the distribution of colours for the population as a whole, the ratio of ellipticals to spirals, the distribution of disc sizes, and the current cold gas content of discs. In spite of the overall success of the model, some interesting discrepancies remain: the colour-magnitude relation for ellipticals in clusters is significantly flatter than observed at bright magnitudes (although the scatter is about right), and the model predicts galaxy circular velocities, at a given luminosity, that are about 30per cent larger than is observed. It is unclear whether these discrepancies represent fundamental shortcomings of the model, or whether they result from the various approximations and uncertainties inherent in the technique. Our more detailed methods do not change our earlier conclusion that just over half the stars in the Universe are expected to have formed since [dN/dM1] [df12/dt1] [M2/M1] dt1 (M1 {\textless} M2). z {\textless}{\~{}}1.5.},

abstract = {We present results from an optical-IR photometric study of early-type galaxies in 19 galaxy clusters out to z=0.9. The galaxy sample is selected on the basis of morphologies determined from HST WFPC2 images, and is photometrically defined in the K-band to minimize redshift-dependent selection biases. The optical-IR colors of the early-type cluster galaxies become bluer with increasing redshift in a manner consistent with the passive evolution of an old stellar population formed at an early cosmic epoch. The degree of color evolution is similar for clusters at similar redshift, and does not depend strongly on the optical richness or X-ray luminosity of the cluster, suggesting that the history of early-type galaxies is relatively insensitive to environment. The slope of the color-magnitude relationship shows no significant change out to z=0.9, providing evidence that it arises from a correlation between galaxy mass and metallicity, not age. Finally, the intrinsic scatter in the optical-IR colors is small and nearly constant with redshift, indicating that the majority of giant, early-type galaxies in clusters share a common star formation history, with little perturbation due to uncorrelated episodes of later star formation. Taken together, our results are consistent with models in which most early-type galaxies in rich clusters are old, formed the majority of their stars at high redshift in a well-synchronized fashion, and evolved quiescently thereafter.},

@article{Spergel2003,
abstract = {WMAP precision data enable accurate testing of cosmological models. We find that the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat $\Lambda$-dominated universe seeded by a nearly scale-invariant adiabatic Gaussian fluctuations, fits the WMAP data. For the WMAP data only, the best-fit parameters are h=0.72+/-0.05, $\Omega$bh2=0.024+/-0.001, $\Omega$mh2=0.14+/-0.02, $\tau$=0.166+0.076-0.071, ns=0.99+/-0.04, and $\sigma$8=0.9+/-0.1. With parameters fixed only by WMAP data, we can fit finer scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements and measurements of large-scale structure (galaxy surveys and the Ly$\alpha$ forest). This simple model is also consistent with a host of other astronomical measurements: its inferred age of the universe is consistent with stellar ages, the baryon/photon ratio is consistent with measurements of the [D/H] ratio, and the inferred Hubble constant is consistent with local observations of the expansion rate. We then fit the model parameters to a combination of WMAP data with other finer scale CMB experiments (ACBAR and CBI), 2dFGRS measurements, and Ly$\alpha$ forest data to find the model's best-fit cosmological parameters: h=0.71+0.04-0.03, $\Omega$bh2=0.0224+/-0.0009, $\Omega$mh2=0.135+0.008-0.009, $\tau$=0.17+/-0.06, ns(0.05 Mpc-1)=0.93+/-0.03, and $\sigma$8=0.84+/-0.04. WMAP's best determination of $\tau$=0.17+/-0.04 arises directly from the temperature-polarization (TE) data and not from this model fit, but they are consistent. These parameters imply that the age of the universe is 13.7+/-0.2 Gyr. With the Ly$\alpha$ forest data, the model favors but does not require a slowly varying spectral index. The significance of this running index is sensitive to the uncertainties in the Ly$\alpha$ forest. By combining WMAP data with other astronomical data, we constrain the geometry of the universe, $\Omega$tot=1.02+/-0.02, and the equation of state of the dark energy, w{\textless}-0.78 (95{\%} confidence limit assuming w{\textgreater}=-1). The combination of WMAP and 2dFGRS data constrains the energy density in stable neutrinos: $\Omega$$\nu$h2{\textless}0.0072 (95{\%} confidence limit). For three degenerate neutrino species, this limit implies that their mass is less than 0.23 eV (95{\%} confidence limit). The WMAP detection of early reionization rules out warm dark matter. WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

abstract = {Although giant clumps of stars are crucial to galaxy formation and evolution, the most basic demographics of clumps are still uncertain, mainly because the definition of clumps has not been thoroughly discussed. In this paper, we study the basic demographics of clumps in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at 0.5{\textless}z{\textless}3, using our proposed physical definition that UV-bright clumps are discrete star-forming regions that individually contribute more than 8{\%} of the rest-frame UV light of their galaxies. Clumps defined this way are significantly brighter than the HII regions of nearby large spiral galaxies, either individually or blended, when physical spatial resolution and cosmological dimming are considered. Under this definition, we measure the fraction of SFGs that contain at least one off-center clump (Fclumpy) and the contributions of clumps to the rest-frame UV light and star formation rate of SFGs in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields, where our mass-complete sample consists of 3239 galaxies with axial ratio q{\textgreater}0.5. The redshift evolution of Fclumpy changes with the stellar mass (M*) of the galaxies. Low-mass (log(M*/Msun){\textless}9.8) galaxies keep an almost constant Fclumpy of about 60{\%} from z{\~{}}3.0 to z{\~{}}0.5. Intermediate-mass and massive galaxies drop their Fclumpy from 55{\%} at z{\~{}}3.0 to 40{\%} and 15{\%}, respectively, at z{\~{}}0.5. We find that (1) the trend of disk stabilization predicted by violent disk instability matches the Fclumpy trend of massive galaxies; (2) minor mergers are a viable explanation of the Fclumpy trend of intermediate-mass galaxies at z{\textless}1.5, given a realistic observability timescale; and (3) major mergers are unlikely responsible for the Fclumpy trend in all masses at z{\textless}1.5. The clump contribution to the rest-frame UV light of SFGs shows a broad peak around galaxies with log(M*/Msun){\~{}}10.5 at all redshifts, possibly linked to the molecular gas fraction of the galaxies.

This decision is often made arbitrarily or subjectively, but it need not be. A jackknife or leave-one-out cross-validation likelihood is defined and employed as a scalar objective function for optimization of the locations and widths of the bins. The objective is justified as being related to the histogram's usefulness for predicting future data. The method works for data or histograms of any dimensionality.},

These common clusters define a tight scaling relation in the richness-SZ mass ($\lambda$-MSZ) plane, with an intrinsic scatter in richness of $\sigma$ {\_}{\{}$\lambda$ |M{\_}{\{}SZ{\}}{\}} = 0.266 ± 0.017. The corresponding intrinsic scatter in true cluster halo mass at fixed richness is ≈21 per cent. The regularity of this scaling relation is used to identify failures in both catalogues. The failure rates for redMaPPer and PSZ1 1.2 per cent and 14.7 per cent, respectively. The PSZ1 failure rates decreases to 9.8 per cent after removing incorrect redshifts that were drawn from the literature. We note the failure rates in the PSZ1 from this analysis are specific to the SDSS overlap region, and may not be indicative of failure rates over the full Planck survey. We have further identified five PSZ1 sources that suffer from projection effects (multiple rich systems along the line of sight of the SZ detection) and 17 new high-redshift (z ≳ 0.6) cluster candidates of varying degrees of confidence.},

abstract = {We present a catalog of 224 galaxy cluster candidates, selected through their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signature in the first 720 deg2 of the South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey. This area was mapped with the SPT in the 2008 and 2009 austral winters to a depth of 18 uK-arcmin at 150 GHz; 550 deg2 of it was also mapped to 44 uK-arcmin at 95 GHz. Based on optical imaging of all candidates and near-infrared imaging of the majority of candidates, we have found optical and/or infrared counterparts for 158 clusters. Of these, 135 were first identified as clusters in SPT data, including 117 new discoveries reported in this work. This catalog triples the number of confirmed galaxy clusters discovered through the SZ effect. We report photometrically derived (and in some cases spectroscopic) redshifts for confirmed clusters and redshift lower limits for the remaining candidates. The catalog extends to high redshift with a median redshift of z = 0.55 and maximum redshift of z = 1.37. Based on simulations, we expect the catalog to be nearly 100{\%} complete above M500 {\~{}} 5e14 Msun h{\_}{\{}70{\}}{\^{}}-1 at z {\textgreater} 0.6. There are 121 candidates detected at signal-to-noise greater than five, at which the catalog purity is measured to be 95{\%}. From this high-purity subsample, we exclude the z {\textless} 0.3 clusters and use the remaining 100 candidates to improve cosmological constraints following the method presented by Benson et al., 2011. Adding the cluster data to CMB+BAO+H0 data leads to a preference for non-zero neutrino masses while only slightly reducing the upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses to sum mnu {\textless} 0.38 eV (95{\%} CL). For a spatially flat wCDM cosmological model, the addition of this catalog to the CMB+BAO+H0+SNe results yields sigma8=0.807+-0.027 and w = -1.010+-0.058, improving the constraints on these parameters by a factor of 1.4 and 1.3, respectively.

abstract = {We investigate the possibility of using the X-ray telescope (XRT) on board the Swift satellite to improve the current accuracy of the ICM temperature measurements in the region close to the virial radius of nearby clusters. We present the spectral analysis of the Swift XRT observations of 6 galaxy clusters and their temperature profiles in the regions within 0.2-0.6 r200. Four of them are nearby famous and very well studied objects (Coma, Abell 1795, Abell 2029 and PKS0745-19). The remaining two, SWJ1557+35 and SWJ0847+13, at redshift z=0.16 and z=0.36, were serendipitously observed by Swift-XRT. We accurately quantify the temperature uncertainties, with particular focus on the impact of the background scatter (both instrumental and cosmic). We extrapolate these results and simulate a deep observation of the external region of Abell 1795 which is assumed here as a case study. In particular we calculate the expected uncertainties in the temperature measurement as far as r200. We find that, with a fairly deep observation (300 ks), the Swift XRT would be able to measure the ICM temperature profiles in the external regions as far as the virial radius, significantly improving the best accuracy among the previous measurements. This can be achieved thanks to the unprecedented combination of good PSF over the full field of view and very accurate control of the instrumental background. Somehow unexpectedly we conclude that, among currently operating telescope, the Swift-XRT is the only potentially able to improve the current accuracy in plasma temperature measurement at the edges of the cluster potential. This will be true until a newgeneration of low-background and large field of view telescopes, aimed to the study of galaxy clusters, will operate. These observations would be of great importance in developing the observing strategy for suchmissions.},

abstract = {Cluster mergers may play a fundamental role in the formation and evolution of cluster galaxies. Stroe et al. revealed unexpected overdensities of candidate H$\alpha$ emitters near the ˜1-Mpc-wide shock fronts of the massive (˜2 × 1015 M⊙) `Sausage' merging cluster, CIZA J2242.8+5301. We used the Keck/Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph and the William Herschel Telescope/AutoFib2+WYFFOS to confirm 83 H$\alpha$ emitters in and around the merging cluster. We find that cluster star-forming galaxies in the hottest X-ray gas and/or in the cluster subcores (away from the shock fronts) show high [S II]6716/[S II]6761 and high [S II] 6716/H$\alpha$, implying very low electron densities ({\textless}30 × lower than all other star-forming galaxies outside the cluster) and/or significant contribution from supernovae, respectively. All cluster star-forming galaxies near the cluster centre show evidence of significant outflows (blueshifted Na D ˜200-300 km s-1), likely driven by supernovae. Strong outflows are also found for the cluster H$\alpha$ active galactic nucleus (AGN). H$\alpha$ star-forming galaxies in the merging cluster follow the z ˜ 0 mass-metallicity relation, showing systematically higher metallicity (˜0.15-0.2 dex) than H$\alpha$ emitters outside the cluster (projected R {\textgreater} 2.5 Mpc). This suggests that the shock front may have triggered remaining metal-rich gas which galaxies were able to retain into forming stars. Our observations show that the merger of impressively massive (˜1015 M⊙) clusters can provide the conditions for significant star formation and AGN activity, but, as we witness strong feedback by star-forming galaxies and AGN (and given how massive the merging cluster is), such sources will likely quench in a few 100 Myr.},

We find that at fixed stellar mass galaxies at z{\~{}}0.7 have just 30{\%}-60{\%} the metal content of galaxies at the present epoch, where the uncertainty is dominated by the strong-line method used to measure the metallicity.

Thus, for this range of redshifts and stellar masses the M-Z relation simply shifts toward lower metallicity with increasing redshift without changing its shape.},

abstract = {We present improved black hole masses for 35 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on a complete and consistent reanalysis of broad emission-line reverberation-mapping data. From objects with multiple line measurements, we find that the highest precision measure of the virial product is obtained by using the cross-correlation function centroid (as opposed to the cross-correlation function peak) for the time delay and the line dispersion (as opposed to full width half maximum) for the line width and by measuring the line width in the variable part of the spectrum. Accurate line-width measurement depends critically on avoiding contaminating features, in particular the narrow components of the emission lines. We find that the precision (or random component of the error) of reverberation-based black hole mass measurements is typically around 30{\%}, comparable to the precision attained in measurement of black hole masses in quiescent galaxies by gas or stellar dynamical methods. Based on results presented in a companion paper by Onken et al., we provide a zero-point calibration for the reverberation-based black hole mass scale by using the relationship between black hole mass and host-galaxy bulge velocity dispersion. The scatter around this relationship implies that the typical systematic uncertainties in reverberation-based black hole masses are smaller than a factor of three. We present a preliminary version of a mass-luminosity relationship that is much better defined than any previous attempt. Scatter about the mass-luminosity relationship for these AGNs appears to be real and could be correlated with either Eddington ratio or object inclination.},

A comparison of different simulations suggests that the dominant uncertainty in our results is systematic and is smaller than 10--30{\%} at all masses, depending on the halo definition used. In particular, our ``Hubble Volume'' simulations of $\backslash$tcdm and $\backslash$lcdm cosmologies allow the abundance of massive clusters to be predicted with uncertainties well below those expected in all currently planned observational surveys. We show that for a range of CDM cosmologies and for a suitable halo definition, the simulated mass function is almost independent of epoch, of cosmological parameters, and of initial power spectrum when expressed in appropriate variables. This universality is of exactly the kind predicted by the familiar Press-Schechter model, although this model predicts a mass function shape which differs from our numerical results, overestimating the abundance of ``typical'' halos and underestimating that of massive systems.},

We describe the pipeline we have developed to process this large data volume, obtain accurate photometric redshifts, and detect optical clusters. Our cluster finding process uses the combination of a matched spatial filter, photometric redshift probability distributions and richness estimation. We present photometric redshifts, richness estimates, luminosities, and masses for 8 new optically-selected clusters with mass greater than {\$}3\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashsun{\}}{\$} at redshifts out to 0.7. We also present estimates for the expected Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) signal from these clusters as specific predictions for upcoming observations by ACT, the South Pole Telescope and Atacama Pathfinder Experiment.},

abstract = {The buildup of stellar mass in galaxies is the consequence of their past star formation and merging histories. Here we report measurements of rest-frame optical light and calculations of stellar mass at high redshift based on an infrared-selected sample of galaxies from the Hubble Deep Field-North. The bright envelope of rest-frame B-band galaxy luminosities is similar in the range 0{\textless}z{\textless}3, and the comoving luminosity density is constant to within a factor of 3 over that redshift range. However, galaxies at higher redshifts are bluer, and stellar population modeling indicates that they had significantly lower mass-to-light ratios than those of present-day L* galaxies. This leads to a global stellar mass density, $\Omega$*(z), that rises with time from z=3 to the present. This measurement essentially traces the integral of the cosmic star formation history that has been the subject of previous investigations. Between 50{\%} and 75{\%} of the present-day stellar mass density had formed by z{\~{}}1, but at z{\~{}}2.7 we find that only 3{\%}-14{\%} of today's stars were present. This increase in $\Omega$* with time is broadly consistent with observations of the evolving global star formation rate, once dust extinction is taken into account, but is steeper at 1{\textless}z{\textless}3 than predicted by some recent semianalytic models of galaxy formation. The observations appear to be inconsistent with scenarios in which the bulk of stars in present-day galactic spheroids formed at z{\textgreater}{\textgreater}2.  Based on observations taken with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope (HST), which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

abstract = {Using new integral field observations of 106 galaxies in three nearby clusters we investigate how the intrinsic scatter of the Fundamental Plane depends on the way in which the velocity dispersion and effective radius are measured. Our spatially resolved spectroscopy, combined with a cluster sample with negligible relative distance errors allows us to derive a Fundamental Plane with minimal systematic uncertainties. From the apertures we tested, we find that velocity dispersions measured within a circular aperture with radius equal to one effective radius minimises the intrinsic scatter of the Fundamental Plane. Using simple yet powerful Jeans dynamical models we determine dynamical masses for our galaxies. Replacing luminosity in the Fundamental Plane with dynamical mass, we demonstrate that the resulting Mass Plane has further reduced scatter, consistent with zero intrinsic scatter. Using these dynamical models we also find evidence for a possibly non-linear relationship between dynamical mass-to-light ratio and velocity dispersion.},

A galaxy class recently discovered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the UFDs appear to be an extension of the classical dwarf spheroidals to low luminosities, offering a new front in efforts to understand the missing satellite problem. They are the least luminous, most dark-matter-dominated, and least chemically evolved galaxies known. Our HST survey of six UFDs seeks to determine if these galaxies are true fossils from the early universe. We present here the preliminary analysis of three UFD galaxies: Hercules, Leo IV, and Ursa Major I. Classical dwarf spheroidals of the Local Group exhibit extended star formation histories, but these three Milky Way satellites are at least as old as the ancient globular cluster M92, with no evidence for intermediate-age populations. Their ages also appear to be synchronized to within {\~{}}1 Gyr of each other, as might be expected if their star formation was truncated by a global event, such as reionization.},

The derived value of sigma(8) is almost independent of the shape of the fluctuation spectrum, but depends strongly on the cosmological density parameter. We find sigma(8) of about 0.52-0.62 for a critical density universe, and sigma(8) of about 1.25-1.58 for a spatially flat universe with Omega(0) = 0.2. Our results conflict with the high amplitude inferred for an Omega = 1 cold dark matter universe from the COBE anisotropy measurements and advocated on other grounds by Couchman {\&} Carlberg (1992). However, our estimates of sigma(8) are consistent with alternative models which provide a good fit to the observed shape of galaxy correlations on scales up to 50/h Mpc and match on to the COBE results on larger scales.},

We revisit the question using deep infrared Wide Field Camera 3 data to probe the rest-frame optical structure of 935 galaxies selected with 0.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 and stellar masses M * {\textgreater} 1010.7 M ⊙ in the UKIRT Ultra Deep Survey and GOODS-South fields of the CANDELS survey. At each redshift, the most compact sources are those with little or no star formation, and the mean size of these systems at fixed stellar mass grows by a factor of 3.5 ± 0.3 over this redshift interval. The data are sufficiently deep to identify companions to these hosts whose stellar masses are ten times smaller. By searching for these around 404 quiescent hosts within a physical annulus 10 h -1 kpc {\textless} R {\textless} 30 h -1 kpc, we estimate the minor merger rate over 0.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 2. We find that 13{\%}-18{\%} of quiescent hosts have likely physical companions with stellar mass ratios of 0.1 or greater. Mergers of these companions will typically increase the host mass by 6{\%} ± 2{\%} per merger timescale. We estimate the minimum growth rate necessary to explain the declining abundance of compact galaxies. Using a simple model motivated by recent numerical simulations, we then assess whether mergers of the faint companions with their hosts are sufficient to explain this minimal rate. We find that mergers may explain most of the size evolution observed at z {\textless}{\~{}} 1 if a relatively short merger timescale is assumed, but the rapid growth seen at higher redshift likely requires additional physical processes.},

abstract = {We study the evolution of galaxy rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) colors in the epoch 4 {\textless} z {\textless} 8. We use new wide-field near-infrared data in GOODS-S from the CANDELS, HUDF09 and ERS programs to select galaxies via photometric redshift measurements. Our sample consists of 2812 candidate galaxies at z {\textgreater} 3.5, including 113 at z = 7 to 8. We fit the observed spectral energy distribution to a suite of synthetic stellar population models, and measure the value of the UV spectral slope (beta) from the best-fit model spectrum. The median value of beta evolves significantly from -1.82 (+0.00,-0.04) at z = 4, to -2.37 (+0.26,-0.06) at z = 7. Additionally, we find that faint galaxies at z = 7 have beta = -2.68 (+0.39,-0.24) ({\~{}} -2.4 after correcting for observational bias); this is redder than previous claims in the literature, and does not require "exotic" stellar populations to explain their colors. This evolution can be explained by an increase in dust extinction, with the timescale consistent with low-mass AGB stars forming the bulk of the dust. We find no significant ({\textless} 2-sigma) correlation between beta and M{\_}UV when measuring M{\_}UV at a consistent rest-frame wavelength of 1500 A. This is particularly true at bright magnitudes, though our results do show evidence for a weak correlation at faint magnitudes when galaxies in the HUDF are considered separately, hinting that dynamic range in sample luminosities may play a role. We do find a strong correlation between beta and the stellar mass at all redshifts, in that more massive galaxies exhibit redder colors. The most massive galaxies in our sample have red colors at each redshift, implying that dust can build up quickly in massive galaxies, and that feedback is likely removing dust from low-mass galaxies at z {\textgreater} 7. Thus the stellar-mass - metallicity relation, previously observed up to z {\~{}} 3, may extend out to z = 7 - 8.},

We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide illustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion of the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1 consists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions, parallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric data set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The second component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band magnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of {\~{}}3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south ecliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set the typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and about 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of {\~{}}0.3 mas should be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of {\~{}}94000 Hipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more precise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the typical uncertainty of the positions is {\~{}}10 mas. The median uncertainties on the mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to {\~{}}0.03 mag over the magnitude range 5 to 20.7. Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping of the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin observational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this first Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the data quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions from the data.},

abstract = {It is generally assumed that the central galaxy in a dark matter halo, that is the galaxy with the lowest specific potential energy, is also the brightest halo galaxy (BHG), and that it resides at rest at the centre of the dark matter potential well. This central galaxy paradigm (CGP) is an essential assumption made in various fields of astronomical research. In this paper, we test the validity of the CGP using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For each group, we compute two statistics, ? and ?, which quantify the offsets of the line-of-sight velocities and projected positions of brightest group galaxies relative to the other group members. By comparing the cumulative distributions of ? and ? to those obtained from detailed mock group catalogues, we rule out the null hypothesis that the CGP is correct. Rather, the data indicate that in a non-zero fraction fBNC(M) of all haloes of mass M the BHG is not the central galaxy, but instead a satellite galaxy. In particular, we find that fBNC increases from ˜0.25 in low-mass haloes (1012 h-1≤M≲ 2 × 1013 h-1 M⊙) to ˜0.4 in massive haloes (M≳ 5 × 1013 h-1 M⊙). We show that these values of fBNC are uncomfortably high compared to predictions from halo occupation statistics and from semi-analytical models of galaxy formation. We end by discussing various implications of a non-zero fBNC(M), with an emphasis on the halo masses inferred from satellite kinematics.},

@article{Bundy2009,
abstract = {Using deep infrared observations conducted with the MOIRCS imager on the Subaru Telescope in the northern GOODS field combined with public surveys in GOODS-S, we investigate the dependence on stellar mass, M *, and galaxy type of the close pair fraction (5 h -1 kpc {\textless} r sep {\textless} 20 h -1 kpc) and implied merger rate. In terms of combined depth and survey area, our publicly available mass-limited sample represents a significant improvement over earlier infrared surveys used for this purpose. In common with some recent studies, we find that the fraction of paired systems that could result in major mergers is low ({\~{}}4{\%}) and does not increase significantly with redshift to z ≈ 1.2, with vprop(1 + z)1.6±1.6. Our key finding is that massive galaxies with M *{\textgreater}1011 M sun are more likely to host merging companions than less massive systems (M * {\~{}} 1010 M sun). We find evidence for a higher pair fraction for red, spheroidal hosts compared to blue, late-type systems, in line with expectations based on clustering at small scales. The so-called "dry" mergers between early-type galaxies devoid of star formation (SF) represent nearly 50{\%} of close pairs with M *{\textgreater}3 × 1010 M sun at z {\~{}} 0.5, but less than 30{\%} at z {\~{}} 1. This result can be explained by the increasing abundance of red, early-type galaxies at these masses. We compare the volumetric merger rate of galaxies with different masses to mass-dependent trends in galaxy evolution. Our results reaffirm the conclusion of Bundy et al. that major mergers do not fully account for the formation of spheroidal galaxies since z {\~{}} 1. In terms of mass assembly, major mergers contribute little to galaxy growth below M * {\~{}} 3 × 1010 M sun but play a more significant role among galaxies with M * gsim 1011 M sun {\~{}} 30{\%} of which have undergone mostly dry mergers over the observed redshift range. Overall, the relatively rapid and recent coalescence of high-mass galaxies mirrors the expected hierarchical growth of halos and is consistent with recent model predictions, even if the top-down suppression of SF and morphological evolution (i.e., "downsizing") involves additional physical processes. Based on observations collected at the Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, and with the NASA/ESA HST, obtained at STScI, which is operated by AURA, under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

abstract = {We use data from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey to study how the spatial variation in the stellar populations of galaxies relate to the formation of galaxies at {\$}1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5{\$}. We use the Internal Color Dispersion (ICD), measured between the rest-frame UV and optical bands, which is sensitive to age (and dust attenuation) variations in stellar populations. The ICD shows a relation with the stellar masses and morphologies of the galaxies. Galaxies with the largest variation in their stellar populations as evidenced by high ICD have disk-dominated morphologies (with S$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}}rsic indexes {\$}{\textless} 2{\$}) and stellar masses between {\$}10 {\textless} \backslashmathrm{\{}Log{\~{}}M/ M{\_}\backslashodot{\}}{\textless} 11{\$}. There is a marked decrease in the ICD as the stellar mass and/or the S$\backslash$'ersic index increases. By studying the relations between the ICD and other galaxy properties including sizes, total colors, star-formation rate, and dust attenuation, we conclude that the largest variations in stellar populations occur in galaxies where the light from newly, high star-forming clumps contrasts older stellar disk populations. This phase reaches a peak for galaxies only with a specific stellar mass range, {\$}10 {\textless} \backslashmathrm{\{}Log{\~{}}M/ M{\_}\backslashodot{\}} {\textless} 11{\$}, and prior to the formation of a substantial bulge/spheroid. In contrast, galaxies at higher or lower stellar masses, and/or higher S$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}}rsic index ({\$}n {\textgreater} 2{\$}) show reduced ICD values, implying a greater homogeneity of their stellar populations. This indicates that if a galaxy is to have both a quiescent bulge along with a star forming disk, typical of Hubble Sequence galaxies, this is most common for stellar masses {\$}10 {\textless} \backslashmathrm{\{}Log{\~{}}M/M{\_}\backslashodot{\}} {\textless} 11{\$} and when the bulge component remains relatively small ({\$}n{\textless}2{\$}).},

abstract = {We combine Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra of 22,000 luminous, red, bulge-dominated galaxies to get high signal-to-noise ratio average spectra in the rest-frame optical and ultraviolet (2600-7000 {\AA}). The average spectra of these massive, quiescent galaxies are early type with weak emission lines and with absorption lines indicating an apparent excess of $\alpha$-elements over solar abundance ratios. We make average spectra of subsamples selected by luminosity, environment, and redshift. The average spectra are remarkable in their similarity. What variations do exist in the average spectra as a function of luminosity and environment are found to form a nearly one-parameter family in spectrum space. We present a high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum of the variation. We measure the properties of the variation with a modified version of the Lick index system and compare to model spectra from stellar population syntheses. The variation may be a combination of age and chemical abundance differences, but the conservative conclusion is that the quality of the data considerably exceeds the current state of the models.},

abstract = {Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) is now the standard theory of structure formation in the universe. We present the first results from the new Bolshoi dissipationless cosmological $\Lambda$CDM simulation that uses cosmological parameters favored by current observations. The Bolshoi simulation was run in a volume 250 h -1 Mpc on a side using {\~{}}8 billion particles with mass and force resolution adequate to follow subhalos down to the completeness limit of V circ = 50 km s-1 maximum circular velocity. Using merger trees derived from analysis of 180 stored time steps we find the circular velocities of satellites before they fall into their host halos. Using excellent statistics of halos and subhalos ({\~{}}10 million at every moment and {\~{}}50 million over the whole history) we present accurate approximations for statistics such as the halo mass function, the concentrations for distinct halos and subhalos, the abundance of halos as a function of their circular velocity, and the abundance and the spatial distribution of subhalos. We find that at high redshifts the concentration falls to a minimum value of about 4.0 and then rises for higher values of halo mass—a new result. We present approximations for the velocity and mass functions of distinct halos as a function of redshift. We find that while the Sheth-Tormen (ST) approximation for the mass function of halos found by spherical overdensity is quite accurate at low redshifts, the ST formula overpredicts the abundance of halos by nearly an order of magnitude by z = 10. We find that the number of subhalos scales with the circular velocity of the host halo as V 1/2 host, and that subhalos have nearly the same radial distribution as dark matter particles at radii 0.3-2 times the host halo virial radius. The subhalo velocity function N({\textgreater} V sub) scales as V -3 circ. Combining the results of Bolshoi and Via Lactea-II simulations, we find that inside the virial radius of halos with {\{}V{\_}circ{\}}=200 {\{}$\backslash$,km s{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\}} the number of satellites is N({\textgreater} V sub) = (V sub/58 km s-1)-3 for satellite circular velocities in the range 4 km s-1 {\textless} V sub {\textless} 150 km s-1.},

In this paper we provide homogeneously calibrated X-ray luminosities, masses and radii, and we present the complete catalog of the ground-based photometry for the GCP clusters. The clusters were observed with Gemini North or South in three or four of the optical passbands g', r', i' and z'. The photometric catalog includes consistently calibrated total magnitudes, colors, and geometrical parameters. The photometry reaches {\~{}}25 mag in the passband closest to rest frame B-band. We summarize comparisons of our photometry with data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We describe the sample selection for our spectroscopic observations, and establish the calibrations to obtain rest frame magnitudes and colors. Finally, we derive the color-magnitude relations for the clusters and briefly discuss these in the context of evolution with redshift. Consistent with our results based on spectroscopic data, the color-magnitude relations support passive evolution of the red-sequence galaxies. The absence of change in the slope with redshift, constrains the allowable age variation along the red sequence to {\textless}0.05 dex between the brightest cluster galaxies and those four magnitudes fainter. The paper serves as the main reference for the GCP cluster and galaxy selection, X-ray data and ground-based photometry.},

abstract = {We present EzGal, a flexible python program designed to easily generate observable parameters (magnitudes, colors, mass-to-light ratios) for any stellar population synthesis (SPS) model. As has been demonstrated by various authors, the choice of input SPS models can be a significant source of systematic uncertainty. A key strength of EzGal is that it enables simple, direct comparison of different models sets. EzGal is also capable of generating composite stellar population models (CSPs) and can interpolate between metallicities for a given model set. We have created a web interface to run EzGal and generate observables for a variety of star formation histories and model sets. We make many commonly used SPS models available from this interface; the BC03 models, an updated version of these models, the Maraston models, the BaSTI models, and finally the FSPS models. We use EzGal to compare magnitude predictions for the model sets as a function of wavelength, age, metallicity, and star formation history. We recover the well-known result that the models agree best in the optical for old, solar metallicity models, with differences at the {\~{}}0.1 magnitude level. The most problematic regime for SPS modeling is for young ages ({\textless}2 Gyrs) and long wavelengths (lambda {\textgreater}7500 Angstroms) where scatter between models can vary from 0.3 mags (Sloan i) to 0.7 mags (Ks). We find that these differences are best understood as general uncertainties in SPS modeling. Finally we explore a more physically motivated example by generating CSPs with a star formation history matching the global star formation history of the universe. We demonstrate that the wavelength and age dependence of SPS model uncertainty translates into a redshift dependent model uncertainty, highlighting the importance of a quantitative understanding of model differences when comparing observations to models as a function of redshift.},

abstract = {In order to study the galaxy population of galaxy clusters with photometric data one must be able to accurately discriminate between cluster members and non-members. The redMaPPer cluster finding algorithm treats this problem probabilistically. Here, we utilize SDSS and GAMA spectroscopic membership rates to validate the redMaPPer membership probability estimates for clusters with {\$}z\backslashin[0.1,0.3]{\$}. We find small - but correctable - biases, sourced by three different systematics. The first two were expected a priori, namely blue cluster galaxies and correlated structure along the line of sight. The third systematic is new: the redMaPPer template fitting exhibits a non-trivial dependence on photometric noise, which biases the original redMaPPer probabilities when utilizing noisy data. After correcting for these effects, we find exquisite agreement ({\$}\backslashapprox 1\backslash{\%}{\$}) between the photometric probability estimates and the spectroscopic membership rates, demonstrating that we can robustly recover cluster membership estimates from photometric data alone. As a byproduct of our analysis we find that on average unavoidable projection effects from correlated structure contribute {\$}\backslashapprox 6\backslash{\%}{\$} of the richness of a redMaPPer galaxy cluster.

abstract = {We study the growth of massive galaxies from z = 2 to the present using data from the NOAO/Yale NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey. The sample is selected at a constant number density of n = 2 × 10-4 Mpc-3, so that galaxies at different epochs can be compared in a meaningful way. We show that the stellar mass of galaxies at this number density has increased by a factor of ≈2 since z = 2, following the relation log Mn (z) = 11.45 - 0.15z. In order to determine at what physical radii this mass growth occurred, we construct very deep stacked rest-frame R-band images of galaxies with masses near Mn (z), at redshifts langzrang = 0.6, 1.1, 1.6, and 2.0. These image stacks of typically 70-80 galaxies enable us to characterize the stellar distribution to surface brightness limits of {\~{}}28.5 mag arcsec-2. We find that massive galaxies gradually built up their outer regions over the past 10 Gyr. The mass within a radius of r = 5 kpc is nearly constant with redshift, whereas the mass at 5 kpc {\textless} r {\textless} 75 kpc has increased by a factor of {\~{}}4 since z = 2. Parameterizing the surface brightness profiles, we find that the effective radius and Sersic n parameter evolve as re vprop (1 + z)-1.3 and n vprop (1 + z)-1.0, respectively. The data demonstrate that massive galaxies have grown mostly inside-out, assembling their extended stellar halos around compact, dense cores with possibly exponential radial density distributions. Comparing the observed mass evolution to the average star formation rates of the galaxies we find that the growth is likely dominated by mergers, as in situ star formation can only account for {\~{}}20{\%} of the mass buildup from z = 2 to z = 0. A direct consequence of these results is that massive galaxies do not evolve in a self-similar way: their structural profiles change as a function of redshift, complicating analyses which (often implicitly) assume self-similarity. The main uncertainties in this study are possible redshift-dependent systematic errors in the total stellar masses and the conversion from light-weighted to mass-weighted radial profiles.},

Assuming a detection limit of 50 photons in the (0.5-2.0) keV energy band with a typical exposure time of 1.6 ks, we predict that eRosita will detect ˜9.3 × 104 clusters of galaxies more massive than 5 × 1013 h-1 M⊙, with the currently planned all-sky survey. Their median redshift will be z≃ 0.35. We perform a Fisher-matrix analysis to forecast the constraining power of ? on the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology and, simultaneously, on the X-ray scaling relations for galaxy clusters. Special attention is devoted to the possibility of detecting primordial non-Gaussianity. We consider two experimental probes: the number counts and the angular clustering of a photon-count limited sample of clusters. We discuss how the cluster sample should be split to optimize the analysis and we show that redshift information of the individual clusters is vital to break the strong degeneracies among the model parameters. For example, performing a 'tomographic' analysis based on photometric-redshift estimates and combining one- and two-point statistics will give marginal 1$\sigma$ errors of $\Delta$$\sigma$8≃ 0.036 and $\Delta$$\Omega$m≃ 0.012 without priors, and improve the current estimates on the slope of the luminosity-mass relation by a factor of 3. Regarding primordial non-Gaussianity, ? clusters alone will give $\Delta$fNL≃ 9, 36 and 144 for the local, orthogonal and equilateral model, respectively. Measuring redshifts with spectroscopic accuracy would further tighten the constraints by nearly 40 per cent (barring fNL which displays smaller improvements). Finally, combining ? data with the analysis of temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background by the Planck satellite should give sensational constraints on both the cosmology and the properties of the intracluster medium.},

We test MAGGIE-L and MAGGIE-M (in which group masses are derived from AM applied to the group luminosities and stellar masses, respectively) on groups of at least three galaxies extracted from a mock Sloan Digital Sky Survey Legacy redshift survey, incorporating realistic observational errors on galaxy luminosities and stellar masses. In comparison with the optimal Friends-of-Friends (FoF) group finder, groups extracted with MAGGIE are much less likely to be secondary fragments of true groups; in primary fragments, its galaxy memberships (relative to the virial sphere of the real-space group) are much more complete and usually more reliable, and its masses are much less biased and usually with less scatter, as are its group luminosities and stellar masses (computed in MAGGIE using the membership probabilities as weights). FoF outperforms MAGGIE only for high-mass clusters: for the reliability of the galaxy population and the dispersion of its total mass. In comparison with our implementation of the Yang et al. group finder, MAGGIE reaches much higher completeness and slightly lower group fragmentation and dispersion on group total masses, luminosities and stellar masses, but slightly greater bias in the latter two and lower reliabilities. MAGGIE should therefore lead to sharper trends of environmental effects on galaxies and more accurate mass-orbit modelling.},

We combine with previously published data to obtain a radial velocity sample with 206 stars, of which at least 176 are probable Fornax members. We detect the hint of rotation about an axis near Fornax's morphological minor axis, although the significance of the rotation signal in the galactic rest frame is sensitive to the adopted value of Fornax's proper motion. Regardless, the observed stellar kinematics is dominated by random motions, and we do not find kinematic evidence of tidal disruption. The projected velocity dispersion profile of the binned data set remains flat over the sampled region, which reaches a maximum angular radius of 65'. Single-component King models in which mass follows light fail to reproduce the observed flatness of the velocity dispersion profile. Two-component (luminous plus dark matter) models can reproduce the data, provided that the dark component extends sufficiently beyond the luminous component and the central dark matter density is of the same order as the central luminous density. These requirements suggest a more massive, darker Fornax than standard core-fitting analyses have previously concluded, with M/LV over the sampled region reaching 10-40 times the M/LV of the luminous component. We also apply a nonparametric mass estimation technique, introduced in a companion paper. Although it is designed to operate on data sets containing velocities for {\textgreater}1000 stars, the estimation yields preliminary results suggesting M/LV{\~{}}15 inside r{\textless}1.5 kpc.},

abstract = {We study the origin of high-redshift, compact, quenched spheroids (red nuggets) through the dissipative shrinkage of gaseous discs into compact star-forming systems (blue nuggets). The discs, fed by cold streams, undergo violent disc instability that drives gas into the centre (along with mergers). The inflow is dissipative when its time-scale is shorter than the star formation time-scale. This implies a threshold of ˜0.28 in the cold-to-total mass ratio within the disc radius. For the typical gas fraction ˜0.5 at z ˜ 2, this threshold is traced back to a maximum spin parameter of ˜0.05, implying that ˜half the star-forming galaxies contract to blue nuggets, while the rest form extended stellar discs. Thus, the surface density of blue galaxies is expected to be bimodal about ˜109 M⊙ kpc-2, slightly increasing with mass. The blue nuggets are expected to be rare at low z when the gas fraction is low. The blue nuggets quench to red nuggets by complementary internal and external mechanisms. Internal quenching by a compact bulge, in a fast mode and especially at high z, may involve starbursts, stellar and active galactic nucleus feedback, or Q-quenching. Quenching due to hot-medium haloes above 1012 M⊙ provides maintenance and a slower mode at low redshift. These predictions are confirmed in simulations and are consistent with observations at z = 0-3.},

The approach is based on adaptive hierarchical refinement of friends-of-friends groups in six phase-space dimensions and one time dimension, which allows for robust (grid-independent, shape-independent, and noise-resilient) tracking of substructure; as such, it is named ROCKSTAR (Robust Overdensity Calculation using K-Space Topologically Adaptive Refinement). Our method is massively parallel (up to 105 CPUs) and runs on the largest current simulations ({\textgreater}1010 particles) with high efficiency (10 CPU hours and 60 gigabytes of memory required per billion particles analyzed). A previous paper has shown ROCKSTAR to have excellent recovery of halo properties; we expand on these comparisons with more tests and higher-resolution simulations. We show a significant improvement in substructure recovery compared to several other halo finders and discuss the theoretical and practical limits of simulations in this regard. Finally, we present results that demonstrate conclusively that dark matter halo cores are not at rest relative to the halo bulk or substructure average velocities and have coherent velocity offsets across a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. For massive clusters, these offsets can be up to 350 km s-1 at z = 0 and even higher at high redshifts. Our implementation is publicly available at http://code.google.com/p/rockstar.},

abstract = {Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) causes one of the most economically important diseases in cattle, and the virus is found worldwide. A better understanding of the disease associated factors is a crucial step towards the definition of strategies for control and eradication. In this study we trained a random forest (RF) prediction model and performed variable importance analysis to identify factors associated with BVDV occurrence. In addition, we assessed the influence of features selection on RF performance and evaluated its predictive power relative to other popular classifiers and to logistic regression. We found that RF classification model resulted in an average error rate of 32.03{\%} for the negative class (negative for BVDV) and 36.78{\%} for the positive class (positive for BVDV).The RF model presented area under the ROC curve equal to 0.702. Variable importance analysis revealed that important predictors of BVDV occurrence were: a) who inseminates the animals, b) number of neighboring farms that have cattle and c) rectal palpation performed routinely. Our results suggest that the use of machine learning algorithms, especially RF, is a promising methodology for the analysis of cross-sectional studies, presenting a satisfactory predictive power and the ability to identify predictors that represent potential risk factors for BVDV investigation. We examined classical predictors and found some new and hard to control practices that may lead to the spread of this disease within and among farms, mainly regarding poor or neglected reproduction management, which should be considered for disease control and eradication.},

abstract = {We present results from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) photometric redshift methods investigation. In this investigation, the results from 11 participants, each using a different combination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and priors, are used to examine the properties of photometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broadband multi-wavelength coverage. The photometry used includes U-band through mid-infrared filters and was derived using the TFIT method. Comparing the results, we find that there is no particular code or set of template SEDs that results in significantly better photometric redshifts compared to others. However, we find that codes producing the lowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimize photometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting, or adding extra smoothing errors. These results therefore stress the importance of the training procedure. We find a strong dependence of the photometric redshift accuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. On the other hand, we find a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift and galaxy color. We find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshift errors (e.g., 68{\%} confidence intervals) that are too small compared to that expected from the spectroscopic control sample. We find that all codes show a statistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. However, the bias is in all cases smaller than the scatter; the latter therefore dominates the errors. Finally, we find that combining results from multiple codes significantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction. We discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometric redshifts and error estimates.},

abstract = {Gas-rich disks in the early universe are highly turbulent and have giant star-forming clumps. Models suggest that the clumps form by gravitational instabilities, and if they resist disruption by star formation, then they interact, lose angular momentum, and migrate to the center to form a bulge. Here we study the properties of the bulges formed by this mechanism. They are all thick, slowly rotating, and have a high Sersic index, like classical bulges. Their rapid formation should also give them relatively high $\alpha$-element abundances. We consider fourteen low-resolution models and four high-resolution models, three of which have supernova feedback. All models have an active halo, stellar disk, and gaseous disk; three of the models have a pre-existing bulge, and three others have a cuspy dark matter halo. All show the same basic result except the one with the highest feedback, in which the clumps are quickly destroyed and the disk thickens too much. The coalescence of massive disk clumps in the center of a galaxy is like a major merger in terms of orbital mixing. It differs by leaving a bulge with no specific dark matter component, unlike the merger of individual galaxies. Normal supernova feedback has little effect, because the high turbulent speed in the gas produces tightly bound clumps. A variety of indirect observations support the model, including clumpy disks with young bulges at high redshift and bulges with relatively little dark matter.},

abstract = {We present the first dynamical mass estimates and scaling relations for a sample of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) selected galaxy clusters. The sample consists of 16 massive clusters detected with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) over a 455 sq deg. area of the southern sky. Deep multi-object spectroscopic observations were taken to secure intermediate-resolution (R{\~{}}700-800) spectra and redshifts for {\~{}}60 member galaxies on average per cluster. The dynamical masses M{\_}200c of the clusters have been calculated using simulation-based scaling relations between velocity dispersion and mass. The sample has a median redshift z=0.50 and a median mass M{\_}200c=11x10{\^{}}14 Msun/h{\_}70 with a lower limit M{\_}200c {\~{}} 5x10{\^{}}14 Msun/h{\_}70, consistent with the expectations for the ACT southern sky survey. These masses are compared to the ACT SZE properties of the sample, specifically, the central SZE amplitude y0, the Compton signal within a 0.5' pixel y{\_}0.5', and the integrated Compton signal Y{\_}200c, which we use to derive SZE-Mass scaling relations. All SZE estimators correlate with dynamical mass with low intrinsic scatter (11{\%}-16{\%}), in agreement with numerical simulations. The influence of dynamically disturbed clusters on these scaling relations is also considered. Using the 3-dimensional information available, we divide the sample into relaxed and disturbed clusters and find that {\~{}}50{\%} of the clusters are disturbed. We conclude that disturbed systems do not significantly bias the scaling relations but might modestly boost their scatter.},

abstract = {The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) provides a unique way to map the large-scale structure of the universe as traced by massive clusters of galaxies. As a spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background, the SZE is insensitive to the redshift of the galaxy cluster, making it well-suited for studies of clusters at all redshifts, and especially at reasonably high redshifts (z {\textgreater} 1) where the abundance of clusters is critically dependent on the underlying cosmology. Recent high signal-to-noise detections of the SZE have enabled interesting constraints on the Hubble constant and on the matter density of the universe using small samples of galaxy clusters. Upcoming SZE surveys are expected to find hundreds to thousands of new galaxy clusters, with a mass selection function that is remarkably uniform with redshift. In this review we provide an overview of the SZE and its use for cosmological studies, with emphasis on the cosmology that can, in principle, be extracted from SZE survey yields. We discuss the observational and theoretical challenges that must be met before precise cosmological constraints can be extracted from the survey yields.},

abstract = {We use semi-analytic techniques to study the formation and evolution of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). We show the extreme hierarchical nature of these objects and discuss the limitations of simple ways to capture their evolution. In a model where cooling flows are suppressed at late times by active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, the stars of BCGs are formed very early (50 per cent at z {\~{}} 5, 80 per cent at z {\~{}} 3) and in many small galaxies. The high star formation rates in these high-z progenitors are fuelled by rapid cooling, not by merger-triggered starbursts. We find that model BCGs assemble surprisingly late: half their final mass is typically locked up in a single galaxy after z {\~{}} 0.5. Because most of the galaxies accreted on to BCGs have little gas content and red colours, late mergers do not change the apparent age of BCGs. It is this accumulation of a large number of old stellar populations - driven mainly by the merging history of the dark matter halo itself - that yields the observed homogeneity of BCG properties. In the second part of the paper, we discuss the evolution of BCGs to high redshifts, from both observational and theoretical viewpoints. We show that our model BCGs are in qualitative agreement with high-z observations. We discuss the hierarchical link between high-z BCGs and their local counterparts. We show that high-z BCGs belong to the same population as the massive end of local BCG progenitors, although they are not in general the same galaxies. Similarly, high-z BCGs end up as massive galaxies in the local Universe, although only a fraction of them are actually BCGs of massive clusters.},

We select the most massive, red elliptical galaxies, passively evolving and without signature of ongoing star formation. Those galaxies can be used as standard cosmic chronometers, as firstly proposed by Jimenez {\&} Loeb (2002), whose differential age evolution as a function of cosmic time directly probes H(z). We analyze the 4000 {\{}$\backslash$AA{\}} break (D4000) as a function of redshift, use stellar population synthesis models to theoretically calibrate the dependence of the differential age evolution on the differential D4000, and estimate the Hubble parameter taking into account both statistical and systematical errors. We provide 8 new measurements of H(z) (see Tab. 4), and determine its change in H(z) to a precision of 5-12{\%} mapping homogeneously the redshift range up to z $\backslash$sim 1.1; for the first time, we place a constraint on H(z) at z $\backslash$neq 0 with a precision comparable with the one achieved for the Hubble constant (about 5-6{\%} at z $\backslash$sim 0.2), and covered a redshift range (0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.8) which is crucial to distinguish many different quintessence cosmologies. These measurements have been tested to best match a $\backslash$Lambda CDM model, clearly providing a statistically robust indication that the Universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion. This method shows the potentiality to open a new avenue in constrain a variety of alternative cosmologies, especially when future surveys (e.g. Euclid) will open the possibility to extend it up to z $\backslash$sim 2.},

The mass map probes both luminous and dark matter, thus providing a tool for studying cosmology. We find good agreement between the mass map and the distribution of massive galaxy clusters identified using a red-sequence cluster finder. Potential candidates for super-clusters and voids are identified using these maps. We measure the cross-correlation between the mass map and a magnitude-limited foreground galaxy sample and find a detection at the 5-7 sigma level on a large range of scales. These measurements are consistent with simulated galaxy catalogs based on LCDM N-body simulations, suggesting low systematics uncertainties in the map. We summarize our key findings in this letter; the detailed methodology and tests for systematics are presented in a companion paper.},

abstract = {One of the most important unresolved issues for galaxy formation theory is to understand the origin of exponential galaxy discs. We use a disc galaxy evolution model to investigate whether galaxies with exponential surface brightness profiles can be produced in a cosmologically motivated framework for disc galaxy formation. Our model follows the accretion, cooling and ejection of baryonic mass, as a function of radius, inside growing dark matter haloes. The surface density profile of the disc is determined by detailed angular momentum conservation, starting from the distribution of specific angular momentum as found in cosmological simulations. Exponential and quasi-exponential discs can be produced by our model through a combination of supernova-driven galactic outflows (which preferentially remove low angular momentum material), intrinsic variation in the angular momentum distribution of the halo gas and the inefficiency of star formation at large radii. We use observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) New York University Value Added Catalog (NYU-VAGC) to show that the median S{\'{e}}rsic index of late-type galaxies is a strong function of stellar mass. For blue galaxies, low-mass galaxies have n {\~{}}= 1.3, while high-mass galaxies have n {\~{}}= 4, with a transition mass of Mstar {\~{}}= 2.5 × 1010Msolar. Our model with energy-driven outflows correctly reproduces this trend, whereas our models with momentum-driven outflows and no outflows overpredict the S{\'{e}}rsic indices in low-mass galaxies. We show that the observed fraction of `bulge-less' exponential galaxies is a strong function of stellar mass. For Milky Way mass galaxies (Vrot {\~{}}= 220kms-1, Mstar {\~{}}= 1011Msolar), less than 0.1 per cent of blue galaxies are bulge-less, whereas for M33 mass galaxies (Vrot {\~{}}= 120kms-1, Mstar {\~{}}= 1010Msolar) bulge-less and quasi-bulge-less galaxies are more common, with 45 per cent of blue galaxies having the S{\'{e}}rsic index n {\textless} 1.5. These results suggest that the difficulty of hierarchical formation models to produce bulge-less Milky Way mass galaxies is, in fact, not a problem. However, the problem of producing M33-like galaxies remains, and will provide a key test for hierarchical galaxy formation models, and feedback models in particular.},

abstract = {(Abridged) The 7-year WMAP data and improved astrophysical data rigorously test the standard cosmological model and its extensions. By combining WMAP with the latest distance measurements from BAO and H0 measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest LCDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is n{\_}s=0.968+-0.012, a measurement that excludes the scale-invariant spectrum by 99.5{\%}CL. The other parameters are also improved from the 5-year results. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, sum(m{\_}nu){\textless}0.58eV, and the effective number of neutrino species, N{\_}eff=4.34+0.86-0.88. We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis. We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z=1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. With the 7-year TB power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved to Delta(alpha)=-1.1+-1.4(stat)+-1.5(syst) degrees. We report significant detections of the SZ effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data. However, it is a factor of 0.5 to 0.7 times the predictions from "universal profile" of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically-expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope collaboration.},

@article{Benitez2000,
abstract = {Photometric redshift estimation is becoming an increasingly important technique, although the currently existing methods present several shortcomings which hinder their application. Here it is shown that most of those drawbacks are efficiently eliminated when Bayesian probability is consistently applied to this problem. The use of prior probabilities and Bayesian marginalization allows the inclusion of valuable information, e.g. the redshift distributions or the galaxy type mix, which is often ignored by other methods. In those cases when the a priori information is insufficient, it is shown how to `calibrate' the prior distributions, using even the data under consideration. There is an excellent agreement between the 108 HDF spectroscopic redshifts and the predictions of the method, with a rms error Delta z/(1+z{\_}spec) = 0.08 up to z{\textless}6 and no systematic biases nor outliers. The reliability of the method is further tested by restricting the color information to the UBVI filters. The results thus obtained are shown to be more reliable than those of standard techniques even when the latter include near-IR colors. The Bayesian formalism developed here can be generalized to deal with a wide range of problems which make use of photometric redshifts. Several applications are outlined, e.g. the estimation of individual galaxy characteristics as the metallicity, dust content, etc., or the study of galaxy evolution and the cosmological parameters from large multicolor surveys. Finally, using Bayesian probability it is possible to develop an integrated statistical method for cluster mass reconstruction which simultaneously considers the information provided by gravitational lensing and photometric redshifts.},

abstract = {Formation theories for central dominant galaxies in clusters require them to be located at the minimum of the cluster gravitational potential. However, 32{\%} (8 out of 25) of the clusters with more than 50 measured redshifts have central galaxies with significant velocity offsets (with respect to other cluster members). By studying their velocity distributions and correlations between velocity and position, I show that the presence of a large peculiar velocity is strongly correlated with the presence of substructure in these massive systems. About 85{\%} (21 of 25) of all well studied clusters show some evidence for substructure, in contrast to the 30{\%}-40{\%} found when using only galaxy or gas distributions. The correlation between substructure and central galaxy location verifies the hypothesis of Merritt and Tremaine (1990), that high peculiar velocities are indicative of recent merger events between less massive systems of galaxies. Dynamical friction should act quickly to pull the central galaxy, the most massive discrete object in a cluster, to the minimum of the potential. The less massive galaxies retain information about their primordial subclusters for a longer period of time. I use an objective partitioning algorithm to assign cluster galaxies to their host subclumps. When galaxies are allocated in this fashion to their subclusters, 75{\%} of the significant velocity offsets are eliminated. Only 2 out of the 25 clusters have central galaxies which are not centrally located when substructure is considered in the analysis.},

We find luminosity densities at z=0.1 in absolute AB magnitudes in a Mpc{\^{}}3 of [-14.10 $\backslash$pm 0.15, -15.18 $\backslash$pm 0.03, -15.90 $\backslash$pm 0.03, -16.24 $\backslash$pm 0.03, -16.56 $\backslash$pm 0.02] in [{\{}0.1{\}}{\{}u{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}g{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}r{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}i{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}z{\}}], respectively, using $\backslash$Omega{\_}0 =0.3, $\backslash$Omega{\_}$\backslash$Lambda=0.7, and h=1, and using Petrosian magnitudes.

Our results are consistent with other estimates of the luminosity density, from the Two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and the Millenium Galaxy Catalog.

abstract = {We use the Mitchell Spectrograph (formerly VIRUS-P) on the McDonald Observatory 2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope to search for the chemical signatures of massive elliptical galaxy assembly. The Mitchell Spectrograph is an integral-field spectrograph with a uniquely wide field of view (107x107 sq arcsec), allowing us to achieve remarkably high signal-to-noise ratios of {\~{}}20-70 per pixel in radial bins of 2-2.5 times the effective radii of the eight galaxies in our sample. Focusing on a sample of massive elliptical galaxies with stellar velocity dispersions sigma* {\textgreater} 150 km/s, we study the radial dependence in the equivalent widths (EWs) of key metal absorption lines. By twice the effective radius, the Mgb EWs have dropped by {\~{}}50{\%}, and only a weak correlation between sigma* and Mgb EW remains. The Mgb EWs at large radii are comparable to those seen in the centers of elliptical galaxies that are approximately an order of magnitude less massive. We find that the well-known metallicity gradients often observed within an effective radius continue smoothly to 2.5R{\_}e, while the abundance ratio gradients remain flat. Much like the halo of the Milky Way, the stellar halos of our galaxies have low metallicities and high alpha-abundance ratios, as expected for very old stars formed in small stellar systems. Our observations support a picture in which the outer parts of massive elliptical galaxies are built by the accretion of much smaller systems whose star formation history was truncated at early times.},

The data are coupled with dust-reddened stellar population models and Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to estimate dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs). In order to probe the dust heating from stellar populations of various ages, the derived SFRs were averaged over various timescales—from 100 Myr for "current" SFR (corresponding to young stars) to 1-3 Gyr for long-timescale SFRs (corresponding to the light-weighted age of the dominant stellar populations). These SED-based UV/optical SFRs are compared to total IR luminosities extrapolated from 24 $\mu$m observations, corresponding to 10-18 $\mu$m rest frame. The total IR luminosities are in the range of normal star-forming galaxies and luminous IR galaxies (1010-1012 L sun). We show that the IR luminosity can be estimated from the UV and optical photometry to within a factor of 2, implying that most z {\textless} 1.4 galaxies are not optically thick. We find that for the blue, actively star-forming galaxies the correlation between the IR luminosity and the UV/optical SFR shows a decrease in scatter when going from shorter to longer SFR-averaging timescales. We interpret this as the greater role of intermediate age stellar populations in heating the dust than what is typically assumed. Equivalently, we observe that the IR luminosity is better correlated with dust-corrected optical luminosity than with dust-corrected UV light. We find that this holds over the entire redshift range. Many so-called green valley galaxies are simply dust-obscured actively star-forming galaxies. However, there exist 24 $\mu$m detected galaxies, some with L IR{\textgreater}1011 L sun, yet with little current SF. For them a reasonable amount of dust absorption of stellar light (but presumably higher than in nearby early-type galaxies) is sufficient to produce the observed levels of IR, which includes a large contribution from intermediate and old stellar populations. In our sample, which contains very few ultraluminous IR galaxies, optical and X-ray active galactic nuclei do not contribute on average more than {\~{}}50{\%} to the mid-IR luminosity, and we see no evidence for a large population of "IR excess" galaxies.},

abstract = {We present quantitative morphologies of {\~{}}300 galaxies in the optically defined green valley at 0.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.2, in order to constrain the mechanism(s) responsible for quenching star formation in the bulk of this population. The sample is selected from galaxies in the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey (AEGIS). While the green valley is defined using optical U - B colors, we find that using a green valley sample defined using NUV - R colors does not change the results. Using Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging, we study several quantitative morphological parameters including CAS, B/T from GIM2D, and Gini/M 20. We find that the green galaxy population is intermediate between the red and blue galaxy populations in terms of concentration, asymmetry, and morphological type and merger fraction estimated using Gini/M 20. We find that most green galaxies are not classified as mergers; in fact, the merger fraction in the green valley is lower than in the blue cloud. We show that at a given stellar mass, green galaxies have higher concentration values than blue galaxies and lower concentration values than red galaxies. Additionally, we find that 12{\%} of green galaxies have B/T = 0 and 21{\%} have B/T {\textless}= 0.05. Our results show that green galaxies are generally massive (M * {\~{}} 1010.5 M sun) disk galaxies with high concentrations. We conclude that major mergers are likely not the sole mechanism responsible for quenching star formation in this population and that either other external processes or internal secular processes play an important role both in driving gas toward the center of these galaxies and in quenching star formation.},

Individual clumps contribute {\~{}}0.5{\%}-15{\%} of the galaxy-integrated rest-frame ≈5000 {\AA} emission, with median of ≈2{\%} the total contribution of clump light ranges from 10{\%} to 25{\%}. The median intrinsic clump size and stellar mass are {\~{}}1 kpc and {\~{}}109 M sun, in the ranges for clumps identified in rest-UV or line emission in other studies. The clump sizes and masses in the subset of disks are broadly consistent with expectations for clump formation through gravitational instabilities in gas-rich, turbulent disks given the host galaxies' global properties. By combining the NIC2 data with Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)/F814W imaging available for one source, and adaptive-optics-assisted SINFONI H$\alpha$ data for another, we infer modest color, M/L, and stellar age variations within each galaxy. In these two objects, sets of clumps identified at different wavelengths do not fully overlap; NIC2-identified clumps tend to be redder/older than ACS- or H$\alpha$-identified clumps without rest-frame optical counterparts. There is evidence for a systematic trend of older ages at smaller galactocentric radii among the clumps, consistent with scenarios where inward migration of clumps transports material toward the central regions. From constraints on a bulge-like component at radii {\textless}{\~{}} 1-3 kpc, none of the five disks in our sample appears to contain a compact massive stellar core, and we do not discern a trend of bulge stellar mass fraction with stellar age of the galaxy. Further observations are necessary to probe the buildup of stellar bulges and the role of clumps in this process.

Within the broad context of hierachical structure formation, we have only a crude picture of how galaxies like our own came into existence. A detailed physical picture where individual stellar populations can be associated with (tagged to) elements of the protocloud is far beyond our current understanding. Important clues have begun to emerge from both the Galaxy (near-field cosmology) and the high redshift universe (far-field cosmology). Here we focus on the fossil evidence provided by the Galaxy. Detailed studies of the Galaxy lie at the core of understanding the complex processes involved in baryon dissipation. This is a necessary first step towards achieving a successful theory of galaxy formation.},

abstract = {The Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-sequence Cluster Survey (SpARCS) is a z'-passband imaging survey of the 50 deg2 Spitzer SWIRE Legacy fields, designed with the primary aim of creating the first large, homogeneously selected sample of massive clusters at z {\textgreater} 1. SpARCS uses an infrared adaptation of the two-filter cluster red-sequence technique. In this paper, we report Keck/LRIS spectroscopic confirmation of two new exceptionally rich galaxy clusters, SpARCS J161315+564930 at z = 0.871 ± 0.002, with 14 high-confidence members and a rest-frame velocity dispersion of $\sigma$ v = 1230 ± 320 km s-1, and SpARCS J161641+554513 at z = 1.161 ± 0.003, with seven high-confidence members (including one active galactic nucleus) and a rest-frame velocity dispersion of $\sigma$ v = 950 ± 330 km s-1. We also report confirmation of a third new system, SpARCS J161037+552417 at z = 1.210 ± 0.002, with seven high-confidence members and a rest-frame velocity dispersion of $\sigma$ v = 410 ± 300 km s-1. These three new spectroscopically confirmed clusters further demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of two-filter imaging for detecting bona fide galaxy clusters at high redshift. We conclude by demonstrating that prospects are good for the current generation of surveys aiming to estimate cluster redshifts and masses at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1 directly from optical-infrared imaging. Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M.

abstract = {The evolution of galaxy clustering from z=0 to z{\~{}}=4.5 is analysed using the angular correlation function and the photometric redshift distribution of galaxies brighter than IAB{\textless}=28.5 in the Hubble Deep Field North. The reliability of the photometric redshift estimates is discussed on the basis of the available spectroscopic redshifts, comparing different codes and investigating the effects of photometric errors. The redshift bins in which the clustering properties are measured are then optimized to take into account the uncertainties of the photometric redshifts. The results show that the comoving correlation length r0 has a small decrease in the range 0{\textless}{\~{}}z{\textless}{\~{}}1 followed by an increase at higher z. We compare these results with the theoretical predictions of a variety of cosmological models belonging to the general class of Cold Dark Matter scenarios, including Einstein-de Sitter models, an open model and a flat model with non-zero cosmological constant. Comparison with the expected mass clustering evolution indicates that the observed high-redshift galaxies are biased tracers of the dark matter with an effective bias b strongly increasing with redshift. Assuming an Einstein-de Sitter universe, we obtain b{\~{}}=2.5 at z{\~{}}=2 and b{\~{}}=5 at z{\~{}}=4. These results support theoretical scenarios of biased galaxy formation in which the galaxies observed at high redshift are preferentially located in more massive haloes. Moreover, they suggest that the usual parameterization of the clustering evolution as $\xi$(r,z)=$\xi$(r,0)(1+z)-(3+ɛ) is not a good description for any value of ɛ. Comparison of the clustering amplitudes that we measured at z{\~{}}=3 with those reported by Adelberger et al. and Giavalisco et al., based on a different selection, suggests that the clustering depends on the abundance of the objects: more abundant objects are less clustered, as expected in the paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation. The strong clustering and high bias measured at z{\~{}}=3 are consistent with the expected density of massive haloes predicted in the frame of the various cosmologies considered here. At z{\~{}}=4, the strong clustering observed in the Hubble Deep Field requires a significant fraction of massive haloes to be already formed by that epoch. This feature could be a discriminant test for the cosmological parameters if confirmed by future observations.},

abstract = {This article is the second in a series in which we perform an extensive comparison of various galaxy-based cluster mass estimation techniques that utilise the positions, velocities and colours of galaxies. Our aim is to quantify the scatter, systematic bias and completeness of cluster masses derived from a diverse set of 25 galaxy-based methods using two contrasting mock galaxy catalogues based on a sophisticated halo occupation model and a semi-analytic model. Analysing 968 clusters, we find a wide range in the RMS errors in log M200c delivered by the different methods (0.18 to 1.08 dex, i.e., a factor of {\~{}}1.5 to 12), with abundance matching and richness methods providing the best results, irrespective of the input model assumptions. In addition, certain methods produce a significant number of catastrophic cases where the mass is under- or over-estimated by a factor greater than 10. Given the steeply falling high-mass end of the cluster mass function, we recommend that richness or abundance matching-based methods are used in conjunction with these methods as a sanity check for studies selecting high mass clusters. We see a stronger correlation of the recovered to input number of galaxies for both catalogues in comparison with the group/cluster mass, however, this does not guarantee that the correct member galaxies are being selected. We do not observe significantly higher scatter for either mock galaxy catalogues. Our results have implications for cosmological analyses that utilise the masses, richnesses, or abundances of clusters, which have different uncertainties when different methods are used.},

Deep-imaging observations were obtained for most of these sources; spectroscopic observations in either in long-slit or multi-object modes were obtained for many. We effectively used 37.5 clear nights. We found optical counterparts for 73 of the 78 candidates. This sample includes 53 spectroscopic redshift determinations, 20 of them obtained with a multi-object spectroscopic mode. The sample contains new redshifts for 27 Planck clusters that were not included in the first Planck SZ source catalogue (PSZ1).},

abstract = {Reducing the scatter between cluster mass and optical richness is a key goal for cluster cosmology from photometric catalogs. We consider various modifications to the red-sequence-matched filter richness estimator of Rozo et al. implemented on the maxBCG cluster catalog and evaluate the impact of these changes on the scatter in X-ray luminosity (LX ) at fixed richness, using LX from the ROSAT All-Sky Catalog as the best mass proxy available for the large area required. Most significantly, we find that deeper luminosity cuts can reduce the recovered scatter, finding that $\backslash$sigma {\_}{\{}$\backslash$ln L{\_}X|$\backslash$lambda {\}}=0.63+/- 0.02 for clusters with M 500c {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1.6 × 1014 h -1 70 M ⊙. The corresponding scatter in mass at fixed richness is $\sigma$ln M|$\lambda$ ≈ 0.2-0.3 depending on the richness, comparable to that for total X-ray luminosity. We find that including blue galaxies in the richness estimate increases the scatter, as does weighting galaxies by their optical luminosity. We further demonstrate that our richness estimator is very robust. Specifically, the filter employed when estimating richness can be calibrated directly from the data, without requiring a priori calibrations of the red sequence. We also demonstrate that the recovered richness is robust to up to 50{\%} uncertainties in the galaxy background, as well as to the choice of photometric filter employed, so long as the filters span the 4000 {\AA} break of red-sequence galaxies. Consequently, our richness estimator can be used to compare richness estimates of different clusters, even if they do not share the same photometric data. Appendix A includes "easy-bake" instructions for implementing our optimal richness estimator, and we are releasing an implementation of the code that works with Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, as well as an augmented maxBCG catalog with the $\lambda$ richness measured for each cluster.},

abstract = {{{We quantify the expected observed statistical and systematic uncertainties of the escape velocity as a measure of the gravitational potential and total mass of galaxy clusters. We focus our attention on low redshift (z {\textless}=0.15) clusters, where large and deep spectroscopic datasets currently exist. Utilizing a suite of Millennium Simulation semi-analytic galaxy catalogs, we find that the dynamical mass, as traced by either the virial relation or the escape velocity, is robust to variations in how dynamical friction is applied to "orphan" galaxies in the mock catalogs (i.e., those galaxies whose dark matter halos have fallen below the resolution limit). We find that the caustic technique recovers the known halo masses (M 200) with a third less scatter compared to the virial masses. The bias we measure increases quickly as the number of galaxies used decreases. For N gal {\textgreater} 25, the scatter in the escape velocity mass is dominated by projections along the line-of-sight. Algorithmic uncertainties from the determination of the projected escape velocity profile are negligible. We quantify how target selection based on magnitude, color, and projected radial separation can induce small additional biases into the escape velocity masses. Using N gal = 150 (25), the caustic technique has a per cluster scatter in ln (M|M 200) of 0.3 (0.5) and bias 1{\%} ± 3{\}} (16{\%} ± 5{\}}) for clusters with masses {\textgreater}1014 M ⊙ at z {\textless} 0.15.},

Star formation in the disks and nuclear regions of galaxies are reviewed separately, then discussed within a common interpretive framework. The diagnostic methods used to measure SFRs are also reviewed, and a self-consistent set of SFR calibrations is presented as an aid to workers in the field.},

@article{George2012,
abstract = {Locating the centers of dark matter halos is critical for understanding the mass profiles of halos, as well as the formation and evolution of the massive galaxies that they host. The task is observationally challenging because we cannot observe halos directly, and tracers such as bright galaxies or X-ray emission from hot plasma are imperfect. In this paper, we quantify the consequences of miscentering on the weak lensing signal from a sample of 129 X-ray-selected galaxy groups in the COSMOS field with redshifts 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1 and halo masses in the range 1013-1014 M ⊙. By measuring the stacked lensing signal around eight different candidate centers (such as the brightest member galaxy, the mean position of all member galaxies, or the X-ray centroid), we determine which candidates best trace the center of mass in halos. In this sample of groups, we find that massive galaxies near the X-ray centroids trace the center of mass to {\textless}{\~{}} 75 kpc, while the X-ray position and centroids based on the mean position of member galaxies have larger offsets primarily due to the statistical uncertainties in their positions (typically {\~{}}50-150 kpc). Approximately 30{\%} of groups in our sample have ambiguous centers with multiple bright or massive galaxies, and some of these groups show disturbed mass profiles that are not well fit by standard models, suggesting that they are merging systems. We find that halo mass estimates from stacked weak lensing can be biased low by 5{\%}-30{\%} if inaccurate centers are used and the issue of miscentering is not addressed.},

When stacked, the observed projected pairwise velocity dispersion of these satellites is sigma{\~{}}160 km/s, in agreement with abundance-matching expectations for their host halo masses. Finally, bright satellites around L* primaries are significantly redder than typical galaxies in their luminosity range, indicating that environmental quenching is operating within galaxy-size dark matter halos that typically contain only a single bright satellite. This redness trend is in stark contrast to the Milky Way's LMC, which is unusually blue even for a field galaxy. We suggest that the LMC's discrepant color might be further evidence that it is undergoing a triggered star-formation event upon first infall.},

abstract = {We examine the kinematic morphology of early-type galaxies (ETGs) in three galaxy clusters Abell 85, 168 and 2399. Using data from the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral field spectrograph we measure spatially resolved kinematics for 79 ETGs in these clusters. We calculate $\lambda$R, a proxy for the projected specific stellar angular momentum, for each galaxy and classify the 79 ETGs in our samples as fast or slow rotators. We calculate the fraction of slow rotators in the ETG populations (fSR) of the clusters to be 0.21 ± 0.08, 0.08 ± 0.08 and 0.12 ± 0.06 for Abell 85, 168 and 2399, respectively, with an overall fraction of 0.15 ± 0.04. These numbers are broadly consistent with the values found in the literature, confirming recent work asserting that the fraction of slow rotators in the ETG population is constant across many orders of magnitude in global environment. We examine the distribution of kinematic classes in each cluster as a function of environment using the projected density of galaxies: the kinematic morphology-density relation. We find that in Abell 85 fSR increases in higher density regions but in Abell 168 and 2399 this trend is not seen. We examine the differences between the individual clusters to explain this. In addition, we find slow rotators on the outskirts of two of the clusters studied, Abell 85 and 2399. These galaxies reside in intermediate to low density regions and have clearly not formed at the centre of a cluster environment. We hypothesize that they formed at the centres of groups and are falling into the clusters for the first time.},

The use of the UVJ diagram as a tool to distinguish quiescent galaxies from star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is becoming more common due to its ability to separate red quiescent galaxies from reddened SFGs. Quiescent galaxies occupy a small and distinct region of UVJ color space and we find most of them to have concentrated profiles with high S{\'{e}}rsic indices (n {\textgreater} 2.5) and smooth structure characteristic of early-type systems. SFGs populate a broad but well-defined sequence of UVJ colors and are comprised of objects with a mix of S{\'{e}}rsic indices. Interestingly, most UVJ-selected SFGs with high S{\'{e}}rsic indices also display structure due to dust and star formation typical of the n {\textless} 2.5 SFGs and late-type systems. Finally, we find that the position of an SFG on the sequence of UVJ colors is determined to a large degree by the mass of the galaxy and its inclination. Systems that are closer to edge-on generally display redder colors and lower [O II]$\lambda$3727 luminosity per unit mass as a consequence of the reddening due to dust within the disks. We conclude that the two main features seen in UVJ color space correspond closely to the traditional morphological classes of early- and late-type galaxies.

abstract = {We present the results of a comparative study of the rest-frame optical and rest-frame ultraviolet morphological properties of 117 star-forming galaxies (SFGs), including BX, BzK, and Lyman break galaxies with B{\textless}24.5, and 15 passive galaxies in the region covered by the Wide Field Camera 3 Early Release Science program. Using the internal color dispersion (ICD) diagnostic, we find that the morphological differences between the rest-frame optical and rest-frame UV light distributions in 1.4{\textless}z{\textless}2.9 SFGs are typically small (ICD{\~{}}0.02). However, the majority are non-zero (56{\%} at {\textgreater}3 sigma) and larger than we find in passive galaxies at 1.4{\textless}z{\textless}2, for which the weighted mean ICD is 0.013. The lack of morphological variation between individual rest-frame ultraviolet bandpasses in z{\~{}}3.2 galaxies argues against large ICDs being caused by non-uniform dust distributions. Furthermore, the absence of a correlation between ICD and galaxy UV-optical color suggests that the non-zero ICDs in SFGs are produced by spatially distinct stellar populations with different ages. The SFGs with the largest ICDs ({\textgreater}{\~{}}0.05) generally have complex morphologies that are both extended and asymmetric, suggesting that they are mergers-in-progress or very large galaxies in the act of formation. We also find a correlation between half-light radius and internal color dispersion, a fact that is not reflected by the difference in half-light radii between bandpasses. In general, we find that it is better to use diagnostics like the ICD to measure the morphological properties of the difference image than it is to measure the difference in morphological properties between bandpasses.},

abstract = {We evaluate the performance of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR8 redMaPPer photometric cluster catalog by comparing it to overlapping X-ray- and Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ)-selected catalogs from the literature. We confirm that the redMaPPer photometric redshifts are nearly unbiased (lang$\Delta$zrang {\textless}= 0.005), have low scatter ($\sigma$ z ≈ 0.006-0.02, depending on redshift), and have a low catastrophic failure rate (≈1{\%}). Both the TX -$\lambda$ and M gas-$\lambda$ scaling relations are consistent with a mass scatter of $\sigma$ln M|$\lambda$ ≈ 25{\%}, albeit with a ≈1{\%} outlier rate due to projection effects ($\lambda$ is the cluster richness estimated employed by redMaPPer). This failure rate is somewhat lower than that expected for the full cluster sample but is consistent with the additional selection effects introduced by our reliance on X-ray and SZ selected reference cluster samples. Where the redMaPPer DR8 catalog is volume-limited (z {\textless}= 0.35), the catalog is 100{\%} complete above TX {\textgreater}{\~{}} 3.5 keV, and LX {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2 × 1044 erg s-1, decreasing to 90{\%} completeness at LX ≈ 1043 erg s-1. All rich ($\lambda$ {\textgreater}{\~{}} 100), low-redshift (z {\textless}{\~{}} 0.25) redMaPPer clusters are X-ray-detected in the ROSAT All Sky Survey, and 86{\%} of the clusters are correctly centered. Compared to other SDSS photometric cluster catalogs, redMaPPer has the highest completeness and purity, and the best photometric redshift performance, though some algorithms do achieve comparable performance to redMaPPer in subsets of the above categories and/or in limited redshift ranges. The redMaPPer richness is clearly the one that best correlates with X-ray temperature and gas mass. Most algorithms (including redMaPPer) have very similar centering performance as tested by comparing against X-ray centers, with only one exception which performs worse.},

abstract = {The large-scale structure of the universe is a complex web of clusters, filaments, and voids. Its properties are informed by galaxy redshift surveys and measurements of peculiar velocities. Wiener filter reconstructions recover three-dimensional velocity and total density fields. The richness of the elements of our neighborhood is revealed with sophisticated visualization tools. A key component of this paper is an accompanying movie which can be viewed and downloaded at http://vimeo.com/pomarede/cosmography. The ability to translate and zoom helps the viewer follow structures in three dimensions and grasp the relationships between features on different scales while retaining a sense of orientation. The ability to dissolve between scenes provides a technique for comparing different information such as the observed distribution of galaxies, smoothed representations of the distribution accounting for selection effects, observed peculiar velocities, smoothed and modeled representations of those velocities, and inferred underlying density fields. The agreement between the large-scale structure seen in redshift surveys and that inferred from reconstructions based on the radial peculiar velocities of galaxies strongly supports the standard model of cosmology where structure forms from gravitational instabilities and galaxies form at the bottom of potential wells.},

@article{Fontanot2009,
abstract = {[abridged] It has been widely claimed that several lines of observational evidence point towards a "downsizing" (DS) of the process of galaxy formation over cosmic time. This behavior is sometimes termed "anti-hierarchical", and contrasted with the "bottom-up" assembly of the dark matter structures in Cold Dark Matter models. In this paper we address three different kinds of observational evidence that have been described as DS: the stellar mass assembly, star formation rate and the ages of the stellar populations in local galaxies. We compare a broad compilation of available data-sets with the predictions of three different semi-analytic models of galaxy formation within the Lambda-CDM framework. In the data, we see only weak evidence at best of DS in stellar mass and in star formation rate. We find that, when observational errors on stellar mass and SFR are taken into account, the models acceptably reproduce the evolution of massive galaxies, over the entire redshift range that we consider. However, lower mass galaxies are formed too early in the models and are too passive at late times. Thus, the models do not correctly reproduce the DS trend in stellar mass or the archaeological DS, while they qualitatively reproduce the mass-dependent evolution of the SFR. We demonstrate that these discrepancies are not solely due to a poor treatment of satellite galaxies but are mainly connected to the excessively efficient formation of central galaxies in high-redshift haloes with circular velocities {\~{}}100-200 km/s.

abstract = {We present a sample of 16 robust z {\~{}} 7 z 850-drop galaxies detected by the newly installed Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3)/IR on the Hubble Space Telescope. Our analysis is based on the first epoch data of the HUDF09 program covering the Hubble Ultra Deep Field with 60 orbits of Y 105, J 125, and H 160 observations. These remarkable data cover 4.7 arcmin2 and are the deepest near infrared images ever taken, reaching to {\~{}}29 mag AB (5$\sigma$). The 16 z {\~{}} 6.5-7.5 galaxies have been identified based on the Lyman Break technique utilizing (z 850 - Y 105) versus (Y 105 - J 125) colors. They have magnitudes J 125=26.0-29.0 (AB), an average apparent half-light radius of {\~{}}0.16 arcsec (lsim1 kpc), and show very blue colors (some even $\beta$ lsim -2.5), in particular at low luminosities. The WFC3/IR data confirm previous Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer detections indicating that the dropout selection at z {\~{}} 7 is very reliable. Our data allow a first determination of the faint-end slope of the z {\~{}} 7 luminosity function, reaching down to M UV {\~{}} -18, a full magnitude fainter than previous measurements. When fixing phi* = 1.4 × 10-3 Mpc-3 mag-1 to the value previously measured at z {\~{}} 6, we find a best-fit value of $\alpha$ = -1.77 ± 0.20, with a characteristic luminosity of M * = -19.91 ± 0.09. This steep slope is similar to what is seen at z {\~{}} 2-6 and indicates that low-luminosity galaxies could potentially provide adequate flux to reionize the universe. The remarkable depth and resolution of these new images provide insights into the coming power of the James Webb Space Telescope.

abstract = {Implications of recent data on the spatial distribution and luminosity function of galaxies are discussed, and it is suggested that the evidence is consistent with a 'unified' scheme in which galaxies and clusters of galaxies evolved at the recombination epoch from small density fluctuations with a smooth power-law spectrum. In the context of the Einstein-de Sitter and 'standard open' Friedmann models, detailed consideration is given to the predicted covariance function of galaxies implied by the gravitational-instability scheme and to the different approximate power-law slopes obtained for the virialized, nonvirialized, and linear regimes. The multiplicity function for clusters and groups of galaxies is analyzed, and the possibility is considered that the galactic luminosity function may be determined by the process of gravitational instability and clustering. A simple theory of constant-curvature isothermal baryon fluctuations is outlined. It is concluded that such fluctuations can form galaxies and clusters at the same time through gravitational instability and that the theory naturally produces the proposed power-law spectrum at recombination.},

abstract = {We analyze the dependence of galaxy structure (size and S{\'{e}}rsic index) and mode of star formation ($\Sigma$SFR and SFRIR/SFRUV) on the position of galaxies in the star formation rate (SFR) versus mass diagram. Our sample comprises roughly 640,000 galaxies at z {\~{}} 0.1, 130,000 galaxies at z {\~{}} 1, and 36,000 galaxies at z {\~{}} 2. Structural measurements for all but the z {\~{}} 0.1 galaxies are based on Hubble Space Telescope imaging, and SFRs are derived using a Herschel-calibrated ladder of SFR indicators. We find that a correlation between the structure and stellar population of galaxies (i.e., a "Hubble sequence") is already in place since at least z {\~{}} 2.5. At all epochs, typical star-forming galaxies on the main sequence are well approximated by exponential disks, while the profiles of quiescent galaxies are better described by de Vaucouleurs profiles. In the upper envelope of the main sequence, the relation between the SFR and S{\'{e}}rsic index reverses, suggesting a rapid buildup of the central mass concentration in these starbursting outliers. We observe quiescent, moderately and highly star-forming systems to co-exist over an order of magnitude or more in stellar mass. At each mass and redshift, galaxies on the main sequence have the largest size. The rate of size growth correlates with specific SFR, and so does $\Sigma$SFR at each redshift. A simple model using an empirically determined star formation law and metallicity scaling, in combination with an assumed geometry for dust and stars, is able to relate the observed $\Sigma$SFR and SFRIR/SFRUV, provided a more patchy dust geometry is assumed for high-redshift galaxies.},

Excluding areas masked by bright stars, the photometric sample covers 3514 square degrees and the spectroscopic sample covers 2627 square degrees (with about 85{\%} completeness). Earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog have formed the basis of many SDSS investigations of the power spectrum, correlation function, and luminosity function of galaxies. We calculate and compile derived quantities (for example, K-corrections and structural parameters for galaxies). The SDSS catalog presented here is photometrically recalibrated, reducing systematic calibration errors across the sky from about 2{\%} to about 1{\%}. We include an explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including all imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position. Finally, we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of objects in the catalog in order to flag deblending and other errors. This catalog is complementary to the SDSS Archive Servers, in that NYU-VAGC's calibration, geometrical description, and conveniently small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and large-scale structure statistics using the SDSS spectroscopic catalog.},

abstract = {The Planck catalogues of SZ sources, PSZ1 and PSZ2, are the largest catalogues of galaxy clusters selected through their SZ signature in the full sky. In 2013, we started a long-term observational program at Canary Island observatories with the aim of validating about 500 unconfirmed SZ sources. In this work we present results of the initial pre-screening of possible cluster counterparts using photometric and spectroscopic data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR12. Our main aim is to identify previously unconfirmed PSZ2 cluster candidates and to contribute in determination of the actual purity and completeness of Planck SZ source sample. Using the latest version of the PSZ2 catalogue, we select all sources overlapping with the SDSS DR12 footprint and without redshift information. We validate these cluster fields following optical criteria (mainly distance with respect to the Planck pointing, magnitude of the brightest cluster galaxy and cluster richness) and combining them with the profiles of the Planck Compton y-maps. Together, this procedure allows for a more robust identification of optical counterparts compared to simply cross-matching with existing SDSS cluster catalogues that have been constructed from earlier SDSS Data Releases. The sample contains new redshifts for 37 Planck galaxy clusters that were not included in the original release of PSZ2 Planck catalogue. We detect three cases as possible multiple counterparts. We show that a combination of all available information (optical images and profile of SZ signal) can provide correct associations between the observed Planck SZ source and the optically identified cluster. We also show that Planck SZ detection is very sensitive even to high-z (z{\textgreater}0.5) clusters. In addition, we also present updated spectroscopic information for 34 Planck PSZ1 sources (33 previously photometrically confirmed and 1 new identification).},

abstract = {We examine the temperature history of gas accreted by forming galaxies in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. About half of the gas follows the track expected in the conventional picture of galaxy formation, shock heating to roughly the virial temperature of the galaxy potential well (T{\~{}} 106 K for a Milky Way type galaxy) before cooling, condensing and forming stars. However, the other half radiates its acquired gravitational energy at much lower temperatures, typically T {\textless} 105 K, and the histogram of maximum gas temperatures is clearly bimodal. The `cold mode' of gas accretion dominates for low-mass galaxies (baryonic mass Mgal{\textless}{\~{}} 1010.3Msolar or halo mass Mhalo{\textless}{\~{}} 1011.4Msolar), while the conventional `hot mode' dominates the growth of high-mass systems. Cold accretion is often directed along filaments, allowing galaxies to efficiently draw gas from large distances, while hot accretion is quasi-spherical. The galaxy and halo mass dependence leads to redshift and environment dependence of cold and hot accretion rates, with the cold mode dominating at high redshift and in low-density regions today, and the hot mode dominating in group and cluster environments at low redshift. The simulations reproduce an important feature of the observed relation between the galaxy star formation rate (SFR) and the environment, namely a break in star formation rates at surface densities $\Sigma${\~{}} 1h275 Mpc-2, outside the virial radii of large groups and clusters. The cosmic SFR tracks the overall history of gas accretion, and its decline at low redshift follows the combined decline of cold and hot accretion rates. The drop in cold accretion is driven by the decreasing infall rate on to haloes, while for hot accretion this slower mass growth is further modified by the longer cooling times within haloes. If we allowed hot accretion to be suppressed by conduction or active galactic nuclei feedback, then the simulation predictions would change in interesting ways, perhaps resolving conflicts with the colours of ellipticals and the cut-off of the galaxy luminosity function. The transition at Mhalo{\~{}} 1011.4Msolar between cold-mode domination and hot-mode domination is similar to that found by Birnboim {\&} Dekel using one-dimensional simulations and analytic arguments. The corresponding baryonic mass is tantalizingly close to the scale at which Kauffmann et al. find a marked shift in galaxy properties, and we speculate on possible connections between these theoretical and observational transitions.},

abstract = {We present the all-sky Planck catalogue of Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) sources detected from the 29 month full-mission data. The catalogue (PSZ2) is the largest SZ-selected sample of galaxy clusters yet produced and the deepest all-sky catalogue of galaxy clusters. It contains 1653 detections, of which 1203 are confirmed clusters with identified counterparts in external data-sets, and is the first SZ-selected cluster survey containing {\textgreater} {\$}10{\^{}}3{\$} confirmed clusters. We present a detailed analysis of the survey selection function in terms of its completeness and statistical reliability, placing a lower limit of 83{\%} on the purity. Using simulations, we find that the Y5R500 estimates are robust to pressure-profile variation and beam systematics, but accurate conversion to Y500 requires. the use of prior information on the cluster extent. We describe the multi-wavelength search for counterparts in ancillary data, which makes use of radio, microwave, infra-red, optical and X-ray data-sets, and which places emphasis on the robustness of the counterpart match. We discuss the physical properties of the new sample and identify a population of low-redshift X-ray under- luminous clusters revealed by SZ selection. These objects appear in optical and SZ surveys with consistent properties for their mass, but are almost absent from ROSAT X-ray selected samples.},

abstract = {We analyze the bivariate distribution, in color versus absolute magnitude (u-r vs. Mr), of a low-redshift sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (2400 deg2, 0.004{\textless}z{\textless}0.08, -23.5{\textless}Mr{\textless}-15.5). We trace the bimodality of the distribution from luminous to faint galaxies by fitting double Gaussians to the color functions separated in absolute magnitude bins. Color-magnitude (CM) relations are obtained for red and blue distributions (early- and late-type, predominantly field, galaxies) without using any cut in morphology. Instead, the analysis is based on the assumption of normal Gaussian distributions in color. We find that the CM relations are well fitted by a straight line plus a tanh function. Both relations can be described by a shallow CM trend (slopes of about -0.04, -0.05) plus a steeper transition in the average galaxy properties over about 2 mag. The midpoints of the transitions (Mr=-19.8 and -20.8 for the red and blue distributions, respectively) occur around 2×1010 Msolar after converting luminosities to stellar mass. Separate luminosity functions are obtained for the two distributions. The red distribution has a more luminous characteristic magnitude and a shallower faint-end slope (M*=-21.5, $\alpha$=-0.8) compared to the blue distribution ($\alpha${\~{}}-1.3, depending on the parameterization). These are approximately converted to galaxy stellar mass functions. The red distribution galaxies have a higher number density per magnitude for masses greater than about 3×1010 Msolar. Using a simple merger model, we show that the differences between the two functions are consistent with the red distribution being formed from major galaxy mergers.},

In addition, we present the dependence of local galaxy density (smoothed on 8 h-1 Mpc scales) on all of these properties. Several classic, well-known relations among galaxy properties are evident at extremely high signal-to-noise ratio: the color-color relations of galaxies, the color-magnitude relations, the magnitude-surface brightness relation, and the dependence of density on color and absolute magnitude. We show that most of the i-band luminosity density in the universe is in the absolute magnitude and surface brightness ranges used: -23.5{\textless}M0.1i{\textless}-17.0 mag and 17{\textless}$\mu$0.1i{\textless}24 mag in 1 arcsec2 [the notation zb represents the b band shifted blueward by a factor (1+z)]. Some of the relationships between parameters, in particular the color-magnitude relations, show stronger correlations for exponential galaxies and concentrated galaxies taken separately than for all galaxies taken together. We provide a simple set of fits of the dependence of galaxy properties on luminosity for these two sets of galaxies and other quantitative details of our results.

abstract = {Intermediate-dispersion spectroscopy for 152 galaxies in the fields of three rich galaxy clusters at z of about 0.31 is presented. In each case, the fraction of blue cluster members is a factor of about 5 greater than that predicted on the bases of a morphology-density relation and color distribution appropriate to spirals in nearby clusters. The nature of this blue galaxy excess is investigated using a spectral systhesis technique and diagnostic diagrams based on colors and line strengths. Most of the blue excess arises from systems which have experienced a burst of star formation between 0.1 and 1.5 Gyr prior to the epoch of observation; in the remainder a substantial burst appears to be still in progress. There is no evidence for any increase in the level of normal spirallike star-formation activity in these clusters or in the number of active nuclei. Velocity dispersions and M/L ratios have been determined for each cluster. A comparison of the distribution of populations in the high-z clusters with the morphological segregation observed in the Coma cluster supports the view that the blue galaxies are progenitors of present-day S0s.},

abstract = {We describe the construction of an X-ray flux-limited sample of galaxy clusters, the REFLEX survey catalogue, to be used for cosmological studies. The survey is based on the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and on extensive follow-up observations conducted in the frame of an ESO key program. In the paper we document the process by which the primary cluster candidate catalogue is constructed prior to the optical follow-up observations. We describe the reanalysis of the RASS source catalogue which enables us to impose a proper flux limit cut to the X-ray source list without introducing a severe bias against extended sources. We discuss the correlation of the X-ray and optical (COSMOS) data to find galaxy density enhancements at the RASS X-ray source positions and the further evaluation of the nature of these cluster candidates. Based also on the results of the follow-up observations we provide a statistical analysis of the completeness and contamination of the final cluster sample and show results on the cluster number counts. The final sample of identified X-ray clusters reaches a flux limit of 3e-12 erg s-1 cm-2 in the 0.1 - 2.4 keV band and comprises 452 clusters. The results imply a completeness of the REFLEX cluster sample well in excess of 90{\%} and a contamination by non-cluster X-ray sources of less than 9{\%}, an accuracy sufficient for the use of this cluster sample for cosmological tests.},

abstract = {We measure the mass function of dark matter halos in a large set of collisionless cosmological simulations of flat LCDM cosmology and investigate its evolution at z{\textless}{\~{}}2. Halos are identified as isolated density peaks, and their masses are measured within a series of radii enclosing specific overdensities. We argue that these spherical overdensity masses are more directly linked to cluster observables than masses measured using the friends-of-friends algorithm (FOF), and are therefore preferable for accurate forecasts of halo abundances. Our simulation set allows us to calibrate the mass function at z=0 for virial masses in the range 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} Msol/h {\textless} M {\textless} 10{\^{}}{\{}15{\}} Msol/h, to {\textless}{\~{}} 5{\%}. We derive fitting functions for the halo mass function in this mass range for a wide range of overdensities, both at z=0 and earlier epochs. In addition to these formulae, which improve on previous approximations by 10-20{\%}, our main finding is that the mass function cannot be represented by a universal fitting function at this level of accuracy. The amplitude of the "universal" function decreases monotonically by {\~{}}20-50{\%}, depending on the mass definition, from z=0 to 2.5. We also find evidence for redshift evolution in the overall shape of the mass function.},

@article{Cimatti2006,
abstract = {We present a new analysis of the rest-frame B-band COMBO-17 and DEEP2 luminosity functions (LFs) of early-type galaxies (ETGs) as a function of luminosity and mass. Our aim is to place new stringent constraints on the evolution of ETGs since z{\~{}}1. We correct the LF({\$}z{\$}) data for the luminosity dimming assuming pure luminosity evolution. However, instead of relying on stellar population synthesis model--dependent assumptions, we adopt the empirical luminosity dimming rate derived from the evolution of the Fundamental Plane of field and cluster massive ETGs.Our results show that the amount of evolution for the ETG population depends critically on the range of luminosity and masses considered. While the number density of luminous (massive) ETGs with M{\_}B(z=0){\textless} -20.5 (Mass {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}11 M{\_}Sun) is nearly constant since z{\~{}}0.8, less luminous galaxies display a deficit which grows with redshift and that can be explained with a gradual population of the ETG "red sequence" by the progressive quenching of star formation in galaxies less massive than {\~{}}10{\^{}}11 M{\_}Sun. At each redshift there is a critical mass above which virtually all ETGs appear to be in place, and this fits well in the now popular "downsizing" scenario. However, ``downsizing'' does not appear to be limited to star formation, but the concept may have to be extended to the mass assembly itself as the build-up of the most massive galaxies preceeds that of the less massive ones. This evolutionary trend is not reproduced by the most recent theoretical simulations even when they successfully reproduce "downsizing" in star formation.},

abstract = {This overview article describes the legacy prospect and discovery potential of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) beyond cosmological studies, illustrating it with examples from the DES early data. DES is using a wide-field camera (DECam) on the 4m Blanco Telescope in Chile to image 5000 sq deg of the sky in five filters (grizY). By its completion the survey is expected to have generated a catalogue of 300 million galaxies with photometric redshifts and 100 million stars. In addition, a time-domain survey search over 27 sq deg is expected to yield a sample of thousands of Type Ia supernovae and other transients. The main goals of DES are to characterise dark energy and dark matter, and to test alternative models of gravity; these goals will be pursued by studying large scale structure, cluster counts, weak gravitational lensing and Type Ia supernovae. However, DES also provides a rich data set which allows us to study many other aspects of astrophysics. In this paper we focus on additional science with DES, emphasizing areas where the survey makes a difference with respect to other current surveys. The paper illustrates, using early data (from `Science Verification', and from the first, second and third seasons of observations), what DES can tell us about the solar system, the Milky Way, galaxy evolution, quasars, and other topics. In addition, we show that if the cosmological model is assumed to be Lambda+ Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) then important astrophysics can be deduced from the primary DES probes. Highlights from DES early data include the discovery of 34 Trans Neptunian Objects, 17 dwarf satellites of the Milky Way, one published z {\textgreater} 6 quasar (and more confirmed) and two published superluminous supernovae (and more confirmed).},

abstract = {This paper presents the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), a one million second exposure of an 11 square minute-of-arc region in the southern sky with the Hubble Space Telescope. The exposure time was divided among four filters, F435W (B435), F606W (V606), F775W (i775), and F850LP (z850), to give approximately uniform limiting magnitudes mAB{\~{}}29 for point sources. The image contains at least 10,000 objects presented here as a catalog. Few if any galaxies at redshifts greater than {\~{}}4 resemble present day spiral or elliptical galaxies. Using the Lyman break dropout method, we find 504 B-dropouts, 204 V-dropouts, and 54 i-dropouts. Using these samples that are at different redshifts but derived from the same data, we find no evidence for a change in the characteristic luminosity of galaxies but some evidence for a decrease in their number densities between redshifts of 4 and 7. The ultraviolet luminosity density of these samples is dominated by galaxies fainter than the characteristic luminosity, and the HUDF reveals considerably more luminosity than shallower surveys. The apparent ultraviolet luminosity density of galaxies appears to decrease from redshifts of a few to redshifts greater than 6. The highest redshift samples show that star formation was already vigorous at the earliest epochs that galaxies have been observed, less than one billion years after the Big Bang.},

abstract = {[Abridged] We present a catalog of 68 galaxy clusters, of which 19 are new discoveries, detected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZ) at 148 GHz in the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) survey of 504 square degrees on the celestial equator. A subsample of 48 clusters within the 270 square degree region overlapping SDSS Stripe 82 is estimated to be 90{\%} complete for M{\_}500c {\textgreater} 4.5e14 Msun and 0.15 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.8. While matched filters are used to detect the clusters, the sample is studied further through a "Profile Based Amplitude Analysis" using a single filter at a fixed $\backslash$theta{\_}500 = 5.9' angular scale. This new approach takes advantage of the "Universal Pressure Profile" (UPP) to fix the relationship between the cluster characteristic size (R{\_}500) and the integrated Compton parameter (Y{\_}500). The UPP scalings are found to be nearly identical to an adiabatic model, while a model incorporating non-thermal pressure better matches dynamical mass measurements and masses from the South Pole Telescope. A high signal to noise ratio subsample of 15 ACT clusters is used to obtain cosmological constraints. We first confirm that constraints from SZ data are limited by uncertainty in the scaling relation parameters rather than sample size or measurement uncertainty. We next add in seven clusters from the ACT Southern survey, including their dynamical mass measurements based on galaxy velocity dispersions. In combination with WMAP7 these data simultaneously constrain the scaling relation and cosmological parameters, yielding $\backslash$sigma{\_}8 = 0.829 $\backslash$pm 0.024 and $\backslash$Omega{\_}m = 0.292 $\backslash$pm 0.025. The results include marginalization over a 15{\%} bias in dynamical mass relative to the true halo mass. In an extension to LCDM that incorporates non-zero neutrino mass density, we combine our data with WMAP7+BAO+Hubble constant measurements to constrain $\backslash$Sigma m{\_}$\backslash$nu {\textless} 0.29 eV (95{\%} C.

The 2dFGRS uses the 2dF multifibre spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, which is capable of observing 400 objects simultaneously over a 2° diameter field. The source catalogue for the survey is a revised and extended version of the APM galaxy catalogue, and the targets are galaxies with extinction-corrected magnitudes brighter than bJ=19.45. The main survey regions are two declination strips, one in the southern Galactic hemisphere spanning 80°×15° around the SGP, and the other in the northern Galactic hemisphere spanning 75°×10° along the celestial equator; in addition, there are 99 fields spread over the southern Galactic cap. The survey covers 2000deg2 and has a median depth of z=0.11. Adaptive tiling is used to give a highly uniform sampling rate of 93 per cent over the whole survey region. Redshifts are measured from spectra covering 3600-8000{\AA} at a two-pixel resolution of 9.0{\AA} and a median S/N of 13pixel-1. All redshift identifications are visually checked and assigned a quality parameter Q in the range 1-5 Q{\textgreater}=3 redshifts are 98.4 per cent reliable and have an rms uncertainty of 85kms-1. The overall redshift completeness for Q{\textgreater}=3 redshifts is 91.8 per cent, but this varies with magnitude from 99 per cent for the brightest galaxies to 90 per cent for objects at the survey limit.

abstract = {(Abridged) We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 micron and 205 micron of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the ISO Photometer. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wavebands and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at lambda{\textgreater}40 micron. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T{\~{}}40-55 K (warm dust) and T{\~{}}20-23 K (cool dust), and with a dust emissivity index epsilon=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60{\%} of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to {\~{}}150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 micron and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 micron is {\~{}}1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. The FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-nearIR stellar emission is within a factor {\~{}}2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20{\%} when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z{\textgreater}1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in sub-mm surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.},

abstract = {We present the rest-frame colors and luminosities of {\~{}}25,000 mR{\textless}{\~{}}24 galaxies in the redshift range 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}=1.1 drawn from 0.78 deg2 of the COMBO-17 survey (Classifying Objects by Medium-Band Observations in 17 Filters). We find that the rest-frame color distribution of these galaxies is bimodal at all redshifts out to z{\~{}}1. This bimodality permits a model-independent definition of red early-type galaxies and blue late-type galaxies at any given redshift. The colors of the blue peak become redder toward the present day, and the number density of blue luminous galaxies has dropped strongly since z{\~{}}1. Focusing on the red galaxies, we find that they populate a color-magnitude relation. Such red sequences have been identified in galaxy cluster environments, but our data show that such a sequence exists over this redshift range even when averaging over all environments. The mean color of the red galaxy sequence evolves with redshift in a way that is consistent with the aging of an ancient stellar population. The rest-frame B-band luminosity density in red galaxies evolves only mildly with redshift in a $\Lambda$-dominated cold dark matter universe. When we account for the change in stellar mass-to-light ratio implied by the redshift evolution in red galaxy colors, the COMBO-17 data indicate an increase in stellar mass on the red sequence by a factor of 2 since z{\~{}}1. The largest source of uncertainty is large-scale structure, implying that considerably larger surveys are necessary to further refine this result. We explore mechanisms that may drive this evolution in the red galaxy population, finding that both galaxy merging and truncation of star formation in some fraction of the blue star-forming population are required to fully explain the properties of these galaxies.},

abstract = {We have used the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys (Ford et al. 2003) to measure the cumulative mass density in morphologically selected early-type galaxies over the redshift range 0.8{\textless}z{\textless}1.7. Our imaging data set covers four well-separated sight lines and is roughly intermediate (in terms of both depth and area) between the GOODS/GEMS imaging data and the images obtained in the Hubble Deep Field campaigns. Our images contain 144 galaxies with ultradeep spectroscopy obtained as part of the Gemini Deep Deep Survey. These images have been analyzed using a new purpose-written morphological analysis code, which improves the reliability of morphological classifications by adopting a ``quasi-Petrosian'' image thresholding technique. We find that at z{\~{}}1 about 80{\%} of the stars living in the most massive galaxies reside in early-type systems. This fraction is similar to that seen in the local universe. However, we detect very rapid evolution in this fraction over the range 0.8{\textless}z{\textless}1.7, suggesting that over this redshift range the strong morphology-mass relationship seen in the nearby universe is beginning to fall into place. By comparing our images to published spectroscopic classifications, we show that little ambiguity exists in connecting spectral classes to morphological classes for spectroscopically quiescent systems. However, the mass density function of early-type galaxies is evolving more rapidly than that of spectroscopically quiescent systems, which we take as further evidence that we are witnessing the formation of massive early-type galaxies over the 0.8{\textless}z{\textless}1.7 redshift range.},

We derive gas-phase oxygen abundances and stellar masses using new techniques which make use of the latest stellar evolutionary synthesis and photoionization models. We find a tight (+/-0.1 dex) correlation between stellar mass and metallicity spanning over 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and a factor of 10 in metallicity. The relation is relatively steep from 10{\^{}}{\{}8.5{\}} - 10{\^{}}{\{}10.5{\}} M{\_}sun, in good accord with known trends between luminosity and metallicity, but flattens above 10{\^{}}{\{}10.5{\}} M{\_}sun. We use indirect estimates of the gas mass based on the H-alpha luminosity to compare our data to predictions from simple closed box chemical evolution models. We show that metal loss is strongly anti-correlated with baryonic mass, with low mass dwarf galaxies being 5 times more metal-depleted than L* galaxies at z{\~{}}0.1. Evidence for metal depletion is not confined to dwarf galaxies, but is found in galaxies with masses as high as 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} M{\_}sun. We interpret this as strong evidence both of the ubiquity of galactic winds and of their effectiveness in removing metals from galaxy potential wells.},

abstract = {(Aims) We present a physical model of the formation of J033239.72-275154.7, a galaxy observed at z=0.41 and characterized by a big young bar of size 6 kpc. The study of this system is particularly interesting for understanding the connection between mergers and bars as well as the properties and fate of this system as it relates to disk galaxy formation. (Methods) We compare the morphological and kinematic properties of J033239.72-275154.7, the latter obtained by the GIRAFFE spectrograph, to those derived from the merger of two spiral galaxies described by idealized N-body simulations including a star formation prescription. (Results) We found that the general morphological shape and most of the dynamical properties of the object can be well reproduced by a model in which the satellite is initially put in a retrograde orbit and the mass ratio of the system is 1:3. In such a scenario, a bar forms in the host galaxy after the first passage of the satellite where an important fraction of available gas is consumed in an induced burst. In its later evolution, however, we find that J033239.72-275154.7, whose major progenitor was an Sab galaxy, will probably become a S0 galaxy. This is mainly due to the violent relaxation and the angular momentum loss experienced by the host galaxy during the merger process, which is caused by the adopted orbital parameters. This result suggests that the building of the Hubble sequence is significantly influenced by the last major collision. In the present case, the merger leads to a severe damage of the disk of the progenitor, leading to an evolution towards a more bulge dominated galaxy.},

We conservatively define the most uniform statistical sample possible, consisting of 15,343 quasars within an effective area of 1622 deg{\^{}}2 that was derived from a parent sample of 46,420 spectroscopically confirmed broad-line quasars in the 5282 deg{\^{}}2 of imaging data from SDSS Data Release Three. The sample extends from i=15 to i=19.1 at z{\textless}3 and to i=20.2 for z{\textgreater}3. The number counts and luminosity function agree well with the results of the 2dF QSO Survey, but the SDSS data probe to much higher redshifts than does the 2dF sample. The number density of luminous quasars peaks between redshifts 2 and 3, although uncertainties in the selection function in this range do not allow us to determine the peak redshift more precisely. Our best fit model has a flatter bright end slope at high redshift than at low redshift. For z{\textless}2.4 the data are best fit by a redshift-independent slope of beta = -3.1 (Phi(L) propto L{\^{}}beta). Above z=2.4 the slope flattens with redshift to beta=-2.37 at z=5. This slope change, which is significant at a {\textgreater}5-sigma level, must be accounted for in models of the evolution of accretion onto supermassive black holes.},

Our analysis is mainly based on an extensive spectroscopic dataset of 445 member galaxies, mostly acquired with VIMOS@VLT as part of our ESO Large Programme, sampling the cluster out to a radius {\~{}}2R200 (4 Mpc). We classify 412 galaxies as: passive, with strong Hdelta absorption (red and blue ones), and with emission lines from weak to very strong ones. A number of tests for substructure detection is applied to analyze the galaxy distribution in the velocity space, in the 2D space, and in the (3D) projected phase-space. Studied in its entirety, the cluster appears as a large-scale relaxed system with a few, secondary, minor overdensities in 2D distribution. We detect no velocity gradient or evidence of deviations in local mean velocities. The main feature is the WNW-ESE elongation. The analysis of galaxy populations per spectral class highlights a more complex scenario. The passive and red strong Hdelta galaxies trace the cluster center and the WNW-ESE elongated structure. The red strong Hdelta galaxies also mark a secondary, dense peak {\~{}}2 Mpc at ESE. The emission line galaxies cluster in several loose structures, mostly outside R200. The observational scenario agrees with MACS J1206.2-0847 having WNW-ESE as the direction of the main cluster accretion, traced by passive and red strong Hdelta galaxies. The latter ones, interpreted as poststarburst galaxies, date a likely important event 1-2 Gyr before the epoch of observation. The emission line galaxies trace a secondary, ongoing infall where groups are accreted along several directions.},

The rest of the sample show Pa$\alpha$ emission along the disk and the spiral arms extending over scales of 3-7 kpc and larger. About half of the sample contains H II regions with H$\alpha$ luminosities significantly higher than those observed in normal galaxies. There is a linear empirical relationship between the mid-IR 24 $\mu$m and hydrogen recombination (extinction-corrected Pa$\alpha$) luminosity for these LIRGs, and the H II regions in the central part of M51. This relation holds over more than four decades in luminosity, suggesting that the mid-IR emission is a good tracer of the star formation rate (SFR). Analogous to the widely used relation between the SFR and total IR luminosity of R. Kennicutt, we derive an empirical calibration of the SFR in terms of the monochromatic 24 $\mu$m luminosity that can be used for luminous, dusty galaxies.},

From these data we infer the radial distribution of the Toomre Q-parameter for these main-sequence star-forming galaxies (SFGs), covering almost two decades of stellar mass (109.6-1011.5 M ⊙). In more than half of our SFGs, the H$\alpha$ distributions cannot be fit by a centrally peaked distribution, such as an exponential, but are better described by a ring, or the combination of a ring and an exponential. At the same time the kinematic data indicate the presence of a mass distribution more centrally concentrated than a single exponential distribution for 5 of the 19 galaxies. The resulting Q-distributions are centrally peaked for all, and significantly exceed unity there for three-quarters of the SFGs. The occurrence of H$\alpha$ rings and of large nuclear Q-values appears to be more common for the more massive SFGs. While our sample is small and biased to larger SFGs, and there remain uncertainties and caveats, our observations are consistent with a scenario in which cloud fragmentation and global star formation are secularly suppressed in gas-rich high-z disks from the inside out, as the central stellar mass density of the disks grows.

abstract = {We study the impact of setting initial conditions in numerical simulations using the standard procedure based on the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA). As it is well known from perturbation theory, ZA initial conditions have incorrect second and higher-order growth and therefore excite long-lived transients in the evolution of the statistical properties of density and velocity fields. We also study the improvement brought by using more accurate initial conditions based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT). We show that 2LPT initial conditions reduce transients significantly and thus are much more appropriate for numerical simulations devoted to precision cosmology. Using controlled numerical experiments with ZA and 2LPT initial conditions we show that simulations started at redshift z{\_}i=49 using the ZA underestimate the power spectrum in the nonlinear regime by about 2,4,8 {\%} at z=0,1,3 respectively, whereas the mass function of dark matter halos is underestimated by 5{\%} at m=10{\^{}}15 M{\_}sun/h (z=0) and 10{\%} at m=2x10{\^{}}14M{\_}sun/h (z=1). The clustering of halos is also affected to the few percent level at z=0. These systematics effects are typically larger than statistical uncertainties in recent mass function and power spectrum fitting formulae extracted from numerical simulations. At large scales, the measured transients in higher-order correlations can be understood from first principle calculations based on perturbation theory.},

abstract = {We present low-resolution (R sime850) spectra for 67 asymptotic giant branch (AGB), horizontal branch, and red giant branch (RGB) stars in the low-metallicity globular cluster NGC 5466, taken with the VIRUS-P integral-field spectrograph at the 2.7 m Harlan J. Smith telescope at McDonald Observatory. Sixty-six stars are confirmed, and one rejected, as cluster members based on radial velocity, which we measure to an accuracy of 16 km s-1 via template-matching techniques. CN and CH band strengths have been measured for 29 RGB and AGB stars in NGC 5466, and the band-strength indices measured from VIRUS-P data show close agreement with those measured from Keck/LRIS spectra previously taken for five of our target stars. We also determine carbon abundances from comparisons with synthetic spectra. The RGB stars in our data set cover a range in absolute V magnitude from +2 to -3, which permits us to study the rate of carbon depletion on the giant branch as well as the point of its onset. The data show a clear decline in carbon abundance with rising luminosity above the luminosity function "bump" on the giant branch, and also a subdued range in CN band strength, suggesting ongoing internal mixing in individual stars but minor or no primordial star-to-star variation in light-element abundances. Based in part on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

abstract = {We examine the performance of a variety of different estimators for the mass of galaxy groups, based on their galaxy distribution alone. We draw galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for a set of groups and clusters for which hydrostatic mass estimates based on high-quality Chandra X-ray data are available. These are used to calibrate the galaxy-based mass proxies, and to test their performance. Richness, luminosity, galaxy overdensity, rms radius and dynamical mass proxies are all explored. These different mass indicators all have their merits, and we argue that using them in combination can provide protection against being misled by the effects of dynamical disturbance or variations in star formation efficiency. Using them in this way leads us to infer the presence of significant non-statistical scatter in the X-ray based mass estimates we employ. We apply a similar analysis to a set of mock groups derived from applying a semi-analytic galaxy formation code to the Millennium dark matter simulation. The relations between halo mass and the mass proxies differ significantly in some cases from those seen in the observational groups, and we discuss possible reasons for this.},

abstract = {Clump clusters and chain galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) are examined for bulges in Near-Infrared Camera Multi-Object Spectrometer images. Approximately 50{\%} of the clump clusters and 30{\%} of the chains have relatively red and massive clumps that could be young bulges. Magnitudes and colors are determined for these bulgelike objects and for the bulges in spiral galaxies, and for all of the prominent star formation clumps in these three galaxy types. The colors are fitted to population evolution models to determine the bulge and clump masses, ages, star formation rate decay times, and extinctions. The results indicate that bulgelike objects in clump clusters and chain galaxies have similar ages and two to five times larger masses compared to the star formation clumps, while the bulges in spirals have roughly six times larger ages and 20 to 30 times larger masses than the clumps. All systems appear to have an underlying red disk population. The masses of star-forming clumps are typically in a range from 107 to 108 M sun; their ages have a wide range around {\~{}}102 Myr. Ages and extinctions both decrease with redshift. Star formation is probably the result of gravitational instabilities in the disk gas, in which case the large clump mass in the UDF is the result of a high gas velocity dispersion, 30 km s-1 or more, combined with a high gas mass column density, {\~{}}100 M sun pc-2. Because clump clusters and chains dominate disk galaxies beyond z {\~{}} 1, the observations suggest that these types represent an early phase in the formation of modern spiral galaxies, when the bulge and inner disk formed.},

abstract = {Much evidence suggests that we live in a flat cold dark matter universe with a cosmological constant. Accurate analytic formulae are now available for many properties of the dark halo population in such a Universe. Assuming current `concordance' values for the cosmological parameters, we plot halo abundance against redshift as a function of halo mass, halo temperature, the fraction of cosmic matter in haloes, halo clustering strength, and the clustering strength of the z= 0 descendants of high-redshift haloes. These plots are useful for understanding how nonlinear structure grows in the model. They demonstrate a number of properties that may seem surprising, for example: 109 Msolar haloes are as abundant at z= 20 as L* galaxies are today; 106 K haloes are equally abundant at z= 8 and at z= 0; 10 per cent of all matter is currently in haloes hotter than 1 keV, while more than half is in haloes too cool to trap photo-ionized gas; 1 per cent of all matter at z= 15 is in haloes hot enough to ionize hydrogen; haloes of given mass or temperature are more clustered at higher redshift; haloes with the abundance of present-day L* galaxies are equally clustered at all z {\textless} 20; the metals produced by star-formation at z {\textgreater} 10 are more clustered at z= 0 than are L* galaxies.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a detailed study of the structures and morphologies of a sample of 1188 massive galaxies with M* ≥ 1010 M⊙ between redshifts z = 1 and 3 within the Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) region of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) field. Using this sample we determine how galaxy structure and morphology evolve with time, and investigate the nature of galaxy structure at high redshift. We visually classify our sample into discs, ellipticals and peculiar systems and correct for redshift effects on these classifications through simulations. We find significant evolution in the fractions of galaxies at a given visual classification as a function of redshift. The peculiar population is dominant at z {\textgreater} 2 with a substantial spheroid population, and a negligible disc population. We compute the transition redshift, ztrans, where the combined fraction of spheroidal and disc galaxies is equal to that of the peculiar population, as ztrans = 1.86 ± 0.62 for galaxies in our stellar mass range. We find that this transition changes as a function of stellar mass, with Hubble-type galaxies becoming dominant at higher redshifts for higher mass galaxies (ztrans = 2.22 ± 0.82), than for the lower mass galaxies (ztrans = 1.73 ± 0.57). Higher mass galaxies become morphologically settled before their lower mass counterparts, a form of morphological downsizing. We furthermore compare our visual classifications with the S{\'{e}}rsic index, the concentration, asymmetry and clumpiness (CAS) parameters, star formation rate and rest-frame U - B colour. We find links between the colour of a galaxy, its star formation rate and how extended or peculiar it appears. Finally, we discuss the negligible z {\textgreater} 2 disc fraction based on visual morphologies and speculate that this is an effect of forming disc appearing peculiar through processes such as violent disc instabilities or mergers. We conclude that to properly define and measure high-redshift morphology and structure a new and more exact classification scheme is needed.},

We present and release photometric redshifts for a uniquely large and deep sample of 522286 objects with i'{\_}AB≤ 25 in the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) "Deep Survey" fields D1, D2, D3, and D4, which cover a total effective area of 3.2 °{\^{}}2. Methods: . We use 3241 spectroscopic redshifts with 0 ≤ z ≤ 5 from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) as a calibration and training set to derive these photometric redshifts. Using the "Le Phare" photometric redshift code, we developed a robust calibration method based on an iterative zero-point refinement combined with a template optimisation procedure and the application of a Bayesian approach. This method removes systematic trends in the photometric redshifts and significantly reduces the fraction of catastrophic errors (by a factor of 2), a significant improvement over traditional methods. We use our unique spectroscopic sample to present a detailed assessment of the robustness of the photometric redshift sample. Results: . For a sample selected at i'{\_}AB≤ 24, we reach a redshift accuracy of $\sigma$$\Delta$ z/(1+z)=0.029 with $\eta$=3.8{\%} of catastrophic errors ($\eta$ is defined strictly as those objects with |$\Delta$ z|/(1+z) {\textgreater} 0.15). The reliability of our photometric redshifts decreases for faint objects: we find $\sigma$$\Delta$ z/(1+z)=0.025, 0.034 and $\eta$=1.9{\%}, 5.5{\%} for samples selected at i'{\_}AB=17.5-22.5 and 22.5-24 respectively. We find that the photometric redshifts of starburst galaxies are less reliable: although these galaxies represent only 22{\%} of the spectroscopic sample, they are responsible for 50{\%} of the catastrophic errors. An analysis as a function of redshift demonstrates that our photometric redshifts work best in the redshift range 0.2≤ z ≤ 1.5. We find an excellent agreement between the photometric and the VVDS spectroscopic redshift distributions at i'{\_}AB≤ 24. Finally, we compare the redshift distributions of i' selected galaxies on the four CFHTLS deep fields, showing that cosmic variance is still present on fields of 0.7-0.9 deg{\^{}}2.

abstract = {Cluster analysis is a primary method for database mining. It is either used as a stand-alone tool to get insight into the distribution of a data set, e.g. to focus further analysis and data processing, or as a preprocessing step for other algorithms operating on the detected clusters. Almost all of the well-known clustering algorithms require input parameters which are hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. Furthermore, for many real-data sets there does not even exist a global parameter setting for which the result of the clustering algorithm describes the intrinsic cluster- ing structure accurately. We introduce a new algorithm for the pur- pose of cluster analysis which does not produce a clustering of a data set explicitly; but instead creates an augmented ordering of the database representing its density-based clustering structure. This cluster-ordering contains information which is equivalent to the density-based clusterings corresponding to a broad range of param- eter settings. It is a versatile basis for both automatic and interactive cluster analysis. We show how to automatically and efficiently extract not only ‘traditional' clustering information (e.g. representa- tive points, arbitrary shaped clusters), but also the intrinsic cluster- ing structure. For medium sized data sets, the cluster-ordering can be represented graphically and for very large data sets, we introduce an appropriate visualization technique. Both are suitable for inter- active exploration of the intrinsic clustering structure offering addi- tional insights into the distribution and correlation of the data.},

abstract = {The strength of gravity-sensitive absorption lines in the integrated light of old stellar populations is one of the few direct probes of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) outside of the Milky Way. Owing to the advent of fully depleted CCDs with little or no fringing it has recently become possible to obtain accurate measurements of these features. Here, we present spectra covering the wavelength ranges 0.35-0.55 $\mu$m and 0.72-1.03 $\mu$m for the bulge of M31 and 34 early-type galaxies from the SAURON sample, obtained with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer on Keck. The signal-to-noise ratio is 200 {\AA}–1 out to 1 $\mu$m, which is sufficient to measure gravity-sensitive features for individual galaxies and to determine how they depend on other properties of the galaxies. Combining the new data with previously obtained spectra for globular clusters in M31 and the most massive elliptical galaxies in the Virgo cluster, we find that the dwarf-sensitive Na I $\lambda$8183, 8195 doublet and the FeH $\lambda$9916 Wing-Ford band increase systematically with velocity dispersion, while the giant-sensitive Ca II $\lambda$8498, 8542, 8662 triplet decreases with dispersion. These trends are consistent with a varying IMF, such that galaxies with deeper potential wells have more dwarf-enriched mass functions. In a companion paper, we use a comprehensive stellar population synthesis model to demonstrate that IMF effects can be separated from age and abundance variations and quantify the IMF variation among early-type galaxies.},

Our method ensures that an object with a specified astronomical color (e.g. g-r and r-i) has a unique color in the RGB image, as opposed to the burnt-out white stars to which we are accustomed. A natural consequence of this is that we can use the same colors to code color-magnitude diagrams, providing a natural `index' to our images. We also introduce the use of an asinh stretch, which allows us to show faint objects while simultaneously preserving the structure of brighter objects in the field, such as the spiral arms of large galaxies. We believe that, in addition to their aesthetic value, our images convey far more information than do the traditional ones, and provide examples from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging, the Hubble Deep Field (HDF), and Chandra to support our claims.

abstract = {We present optical spectroscopy of galaxies in clusters detected through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect with the South Pole Telescope (SPT). We report our own measurements of 61 spectroscopic cluster redshifts, and 48 velocity dispersions each calculated with more than 15 member galaxies. This catalog also includes 19 dispersions of SPT-observed clusters previously reported in the literature. The majority of the clusters in this paper are SPT-discovered; of these, most have been previously reported in other SPT cluster catalogs, and five are reported here as SPT discoveries for the first time. By performing a resampling analysis of galaxy velocities, we find that unbiased velocity dispersions can be obtained from a relatively small number of member galaxies (lsim 30), but with increased systematic scatter. We use this analysis to determine statistical confidence intervals that include the effect of membership selection. We fit scaling relations between the observed cluster velocity dispersions and mass estimates from SZ and X-ray observables. In both cases, the results are consistent with the scaling relation between velocity dispersion and mass expected from dark-matter simulations. We measure a {\~{}}30{\%} log-normal scatter in dispersion at fixed mass, and a {\~{}}10{\%} offset in the normalization of the dispersion-mass relation when compared to the expectation from simulations, which is within the expected level of systematic uncertainty.},

abstract = {Although grand-design spiral galaxies are relatively common in the local Universe, only one has been spectroscopically confirmed to lie at redshift z {\textgreater} 2 (HDFX 28; z = 2.011); and it may prove to be a major merger that simply resembles a spiral in projection. The rarity of spirals has been explained as a result of disks being dynamically 'hot' at z {\textgreater} 2 (refs 2-5), which may instead favour the formation of commonly observed clumpy structures. Alternatively, current instrumentation may simply not be sensitive enough to detect spiral structures comparable to those in the modern Universe. At z {\textless} 2, the velocity dispersion of disks decreases, and spiral galaxies are more numerous by z ≈ 1 (refs 7, 13-15). Here we report observations of the grand-design spiral galaxy Q2343-BX442 at z = 2.18. Spectroscopy of ionized gas shows that the disk is dynamically hot, implying an uncertain origin for the spiral structure. The kinematics of the galaxy are consistent with a thick disk undergoing a minor merger, which can drive the formation of short-lived spiral structure. A duty cycle of {\textless}100 Myr for such tidally induced spiral structure in a hot massive disk is consistent with its rarity.},

abstract = {We present {\$}K{\$}-band luminosity functions for galaxies in a heterogeneous sample of 38 clusters at {\$}0.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1{\$}. Using infrared-selected galaxy samples which generally reach 2 magnitudes fainter than the characteristic galaxy luminosity {\$}L{\^{}}*{\$}, we fit Schechter functions to background-corrected cluster galaxy counts to determine {\$}K{\^{}}*{\$} as a function of redshift. Because of the magnitude limit of our data, the faint-end slope {\$}\backslashalpha{\$} is fixed at -0.9 in the fitting process. We find that {\$}K{\^{}}*(z){\$} departs from no-evolution predictions at {\$}z {\textgreater} 0.4{\$}, and is consistent with the behavior of a simple, passive luminosity evolution model in which galaxies form all their stars in a single burst at {\$}z{\_}f = 2 (3){\$} in an {\$}H{\_}0 = 65 km/s Mpc{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}, \backslashOmega{\_}M = 0.3, \backslashOmega{\_}{\{}\backslashLambda{\}}=0.7 (0){\$} universe. This differs from the flat or negative infrared luminosity evolution which has been reported for high redshift field galaxy samples. We find that the observed evolution appears to be insensitive to cluster X-ray luminosity or optical richness, implying little variation in the evolutionary history of galaxies over the range of environmental densities spanned by our cluster sample. These results support and extend previous analyses based on the color evolution of high redshift cluster E/S0 galaxies, indicating not only that their stellar populations formed at high redshift, but that the assembly of the galaxies themselves was largely complete by {\$}z \backslashapprox 1{\$}, and that subsequent evolution down to the present epoch was primarily passive.},

A theoretical basis that describes clusters as massive, multicomponent, quasi-equilibrium systems is growing in its capability to interpret multiwavelength observations of expanding scope and sensitivity. We review current cosmological results, including contributions to fundamental physics, obtained from observations of galaxy clusters. These results are consistent with and complementary to those from other methods. We highlight several areas of opportunity for the next few years, and emphasize the need for accurate modeling of survey selection and sources of systematic error. Capitalizing on these opportunities will require a multiwavelength approach and the application of rigorous statistical frameworks, utilizing the combined strengths of observers, simulators, and theorists.},

abstract = {The mean density of the universe is equal to the mass of a large galaxy cluster divided by the equivalent comoving volume in the field from which that mass originated. To reexamine the rich cluster {\{}OMEGA{\}}- value the CNOC Cluster Survey has observed 16 high X-ray luminosity clusters in the redshift range 0.17-0.55, obtaining approximately 2600 velocities in their fields. The systemic redshift, the rms line-of-sight velocity dispersion $\sigma${\_}1{\_}, and the mean harmonic radius rnu{\_} are derived for each cluster using algorithms that correct for interlopers in redshift space and measure the angular extent of the sampling. The virial mass, and its internal error, are derived from $\sigma${\_}1{\_} and rnu{\_}. The cluster luminosity is estimated from the K-corrected r-band luminosities of the cluster galaxies. Directly adding all the light to M{\_}r{\_}{\^{}}K{\^{}} = - 18.5 mag, about 0.2L{\_}sun{\_}, and extrapolating for the small amount of light below the limit, the average mass-to-light ratio of the clusters is 295 +/- 53 h M{\_}sun{\_} L{\_}sun{\_}{\^{}}-1{\^{}}, and the average mass per galaxy to M{\_}r{\_}{\^{}}K{\^{}} = - 19.0 mag is 4.2 +/- 1.1 x 10{\^{}}12{\^{}} h{\^{}}-1{\^{}} M{\_}sun{\_}. The clusters are consistent with having a universal Mnu{\_}/L-value (within the errors of about 25{\%}) independent of their velocity dispersion, mean color of their galaxies, blue galaxy content, redshift, or mean interior density. Using field galaxies within the same data set, with the same corrections, we find that the closure mass-to-light ratio, $\rho${\_}c{\_}/j, is 1025 +/- 140 h M{\_}sun{\_} L{\_}sun{\_}{\^{}}-1{\^{}}, and the closure mass per galaxy to M{\_}r{\_}{\^{}}K{\^{}} = - 19.0 mag, $\rho${\_}c{\_}/{\{}PHI{\}} is 15.5 +/- 3.0 x 10{\^{}}12{\^{}} h{\^{}}-1{\^{}} M{\_}sun{\_}. Under the assumptions that the galaxies are distributed like the mass and that the galaxy luminosities and numbers are statistically conserved, assumptions that these data indirectly support, {\{}OMEGA{\}}{\_}0{\_} = 0.24 +/- 0.05 +/- 0.09, where the errors are, respectively, the 1 $\sigma$ random error and an estimate of the possible systematic error resulting from the normalization to galaxy content.},

abstract = {We introduce a new quantity, the mass flux density of galaxies evolving from the blue sequence to the red sequence. We propose a simple technique for constraining this mass flux using the volume-corrected number density in the extinction-corrected UV-optical color-magnitude distribution, the stellar age indexes H$\delta$A and Dn(4000), and a simple prescription for spectral evolution using a quenched star formation history. We exploit the excellent separation of red and blue sequences in the NUV-r band Hess function. The final value we measure, $\rho$T˙=0.033 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3, is strictly speaking an upper limit due to the possible contributions of bursting, composite, and extincted galaxies. However, it compares favorably with estimates of the average mass flux that we make based on the red luminosity function evolution derived from the DEEP2 and COMBO-17 surveys, $\rho$˙R=+0.034 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3. We find that the blue sequence mass has remained roughly constant since z=1 ($\rho$B˙{\~{}}=0.01 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3, but the average on-going star formation of $\rho$˙SF{\~{}}=0.037 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3 over 0{\textless}z{\textless}1 is balanced by mass flux off the blue sequence. We explore the nature of the galaxies in the transition zone with particular attention to the frequency and impact of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The AGN fraction peaks in the transition zone. We find circumstantial, albeit weak evidence that the quench rates are higher in higher luminosity AGNs.},

@article{Gonzalez2007,
abstract = {We determine the contribution of stars in galaxies, intracluster stars, and the intracluster medium to the total baryon budget in nearby galaxy clusters and groups. We find that the baryon mass fraction (f{\_}b) within r500 is constant for systems with M500 between 6e13 and 1e15 Msun. Although f{\_}b is lower than the WMAP value, the shortfall is on the order of both the observational systematic uncertainties and the depletion of baryons within r500 that is predicted by simulations. The data therefore provide no compelling evidence for undetected baryonic components, particularly any that vary in importance with cluster mass. A unique feature of the current analysis is direct inclusion of the contribution of intracluster light (ICL) in the baryon budget. The increase in X-ray gas mass fraction with increasing total mass is entirely accounted for by a decrease in the total stellar mass fraction, supporting the argument that the behavior of both the stellar and X-ray gas components is dominated by a decrease in star formation efficiency in more massive environments. Within just the stellar component, the fraction of the total stellar luminosity in the BCG and ICL decreases as velocity dispersion increases, suggesting that the BCG+ICL component, and in particular the dominant ICL component, grows less efficiently in higher mass environments. The degree to which this behavior arises from our sample selection, which favored systems with central, giant elliptical galaxies, remains unclear. A more robust result is the identification of low mass groups with large BCG+ICL components, demonstrating that the creation of intracluster stars does not require a massive cluster environment. Within r500 and r200, the BCG+ICL contributes on average 40{\%} and 33{\%} of the total stellar light, respectively.},

It provides an overview of dark energy science and describes the current and anticipated state of the field. It makes the case for the DESC by laying out a robust analytical framework for dark energy science that has been defined by its members and the comprehensive three-year work plan they have developed for implementing that framework. The analysis working groups cover five key probes of dark energy: weak lensing, large scale structure, galaxy clusters, Type Ia supernovae, and strong lensing. The computing working groups span cosmological simulations, galaxy catalogs, photon simulations and a systematic software and computational framework for LSST dark energy data analysis. The technical working groups make the connection between dark energy science and the LSST system. The working groups have close linkages, especially through the use of the photon simulations to study the impact of instrument design and survey strategy on analysis methodology and cosmological parameter estimation. The white paper describes several high priority tasks identified by each of the 16 working groups. Over the next three years these tasks will help prepare for LSST analysis, make synergistic connections with ongoing cosmological surveys and provide the dark energy community with state of the art analysis tools. Members of the community are invited to join the LSST DESC, according to the membership policies described in the white paper. Applications to sign up for associate membership may be made by submitting the Web form at http://www.slac.stanford.edu/exp/lsst/desc/signup.html with a short statement of the work they wish to pursue that is relevant to the LSST DESC.},

abstract = {We describe the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) Early Release Science (ERS) observations in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) South field. The new WFC3 ERS data provide calibrated, drizzled mosaics in the UV filters F225W, F275W, and F336W, as well as in the near-IR filters F098M (Ys ), F125W (J), and F160W (H) with 1-2 HST orbits per filter. Together with the existing HST Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) GOODS-South mosaics in the BViz filters, these panchromatic 10-band ERS data cover 40-50 arcmin2 at 0.2-1.7 $\mu$m in wavelength at 0farcs07-0farcs15 FWHM resolution and 0farcs090 Multidrizzled pixels to depths of AB sime 26.0-27.0 mag (5$\sigma$) for point sources, and AB sime 25.5-26.5 mag for compact galaxies. In this paper, we describe (1) the scientific rationale, and the data taking plus reduction procedures of the panchromatic 10-band ERS mosaics, (2) the procedure of generating object catalogs across the 10 different ERS filters, and the specific star-galaxy separation techniques used, and (3) the reliability and completeness of the object catalogs from the WFC3 ERS mosaics. The excellent 0farcs07-0farcs15 FWHM resolution of HST/WFC3 and ACS makes star-galaxy separation straightforward over a factor of 10 in wavelength to AB sime 25-26 mag from the UV to the near-IR, respectively. Our main results are: (1) proper motion of faint ERS stars is detected over 6 years at 3.06 ± 0.66 mas year-1 (4.6$\sigma$), consistent with Galactic structure models; (2) both the Galactic star counts and the galaxy counts show mild but significant trends of decreasing count slopes from the mid-UV to the near-IR over a factor of 10 in wavelength; (3) combining the 10-band ERS counts with the panchromatic Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey counts at the bright end (10 mag {\textless}{\~{}} AB lsim 20 mag) and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field counts in the BVizYsJH filters at the faint end (24 mag {\textless}{\~{}} AB lsim 30 mag) yields galaxy counts that are well measured over the entire flux range 10 mag {\textless}{\~{}} AB lsim 30 mag for 0.2-2 $\mu$m in wavelength; (4) simple luminosity+density evolution models can fit the galaxy counts over this entire flux range. However, no single model can explain the counts over this entire flux range in all 10 filters simultaneously. More sophisticated models of galaxy assembly are needed to reproduce the overall constraints provided by the current panchromatic galaxy counts for 10 mag {\textless}{\~{}} AB lsim 30 mag over a factor of 10 in wavelength.

abstract = {The potential of using cluster clustering for calibrating the mass-observable relation of galaxy clusters has been recognized theoretically for over a decade. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of this technique to achieve high precision mass calibration using redMaPPer clusters in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey North Galactic Cap. By including cross-correlations between several richness bins in our analysis we significantly improve the statistical precision of our mass constraints. The amplitude of the mass-richness relation is constrained to 7{\%} statistical precision. However, the error budget is systematics dominated, reaching an 18{\%} total error that is dominated by theoretical uncertainty in the bias-mass relation for dark matter halos. We perform a detailed treatment of the effects of assembly bias on our analysis, finding that the contribution of such effects to our parameter uncertainties is somewhat greater than that of measurement noise. We confirm the results from Miyatake et al. (2015) that the clustering amplitude of redMaPPer clusters depends on galaxy concentration, and provide additional evidence in support of this effect being due to some form of assembly bias. The results presented here demonstrate the power of cluster clustering for mass calibration and cosmology provided the current theoretical systematics can be ameliorated.},

abstract = {We study the use of red sequence selected galaxy spectroscopy for unbiased estimation of galaxy cluster masses. We use the publicly available galaxy catalog produced using the semi-analytic model of De Lucia {\&} Blaizot (2007) on the Millenium Simulation (Springel et al. 2005). We explore the impacts on selection using galaxy color, projected separation from the cluster center, and galaxy luminosity. We study the relationship between cluster mass and velocity dispersion and identify and characterize the following sources of bias and scatter: halo triaxiality, dynamical friction of red luminous galaxies and interlopers. We show that due to halo triaxiality the intrinsic scatter of estimated line of sight dynamical mass is about three times larger (30-40{\%}) than the one estimated using the 3D velocity dispersion ({\~{}}12{\%}) and a small bias ({\~{}}1{\%}) is induced. We find evidence of increasing scatter as a function of redshift and provide a fitting formula to account for it. We characterize the amount of bias and scatter introduced by dynamical friction when using subsamples of red-luminous galaxies to estimate the velocity dispersion. We study the presence of interlopers in spectroscopic samples and their effect on the estimated cluster dynamical mass. Our results show that while cluster velocity dispersions extracted from a few dozen red sequence selected galaxies do not provide precise masses on a single cluster basis, an ensemble of cluster velocity dispersions can be combined to produce a precise calibration of a cluster survey mass observable relation. Currently, disagreements in the literature on simulated subhalo velocity dispersion mass relations place a systematic floor on velocity dispersion mass calibration at the 15{\%} level in mass. We show that the selection related uncertainties are small by comparison, providing hope that with further improvements this systematic floor can be reduced.},

@article{Hopkins2006a,
abstract = {We consider the distribution of local supermassive black hole Eddington ratios and accretion rates, accounting for the dependence of radiative efficiency and bolometric corrections on the accretion rate. We find that black hole mass growth, both of the integrated mass density and the masses of most individual objects, must be dominated by an earlier, radiatively efficient, high accretion rate stage, and not by the radiatively inefficient low accretion rate phase in which most local supermassive black holes are currently observed. This conclusion is particularly true of supermassive black holes in elliptical host galaxies, as expected if they have undergone merger activity in the past which would fuel quasar activity and rapid growth. We discuss models of the time evolution of accretion rates and show that they all predict significant mass growth in a prior radiatively efficient state. The only way to avoid this conclusion is through careful fine-tuning of the accretion/quasar timescale to a value that is inconsistent with observations. Our results agree with a wide range of observational inferences drawn from the quasar luminosity function and X-ray background synthesis models, but our approach has the virtue of being independent of the modeling of source populations. Models in which black holes spend the great majority of their time in low accretion rate phases are thus completely consistent both with observations implying mass gain in relatively short, high accretion rate phases and with the local distribution of accretion rates.},

abstract = {We identify new clusters and characterize previously unknown Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) sources from the first Planck catalogue of SZ sources (PSZ1). The results presented here correspond to an optical follow-up observational programme developed during approximately one year (2014) at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, using the 2.5m Isaac Newton telescope, the 3.5m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, the 4.2m William Herschel telescope and the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias. We characterize 115 new PSZ1 sources using deep optical imaging and spectroscopy. We adopt robust criteria in order to consolidate the SZ counterparts by analysing the optical richness, the 2D galaxy distribution, and velocity dispersions of clusters. Confirmed counterparts are considered to be validated if they are rich structures, well aligned with the Planck PSZ1 coordinate and show relatively high velocity dispersion. Following this classification, we confirm 53 clusters, which means that 46{\%} of this PSZ1 subsample has been validated and characterized with this technique. Sixty-two SZ sources (54{\%} of this PSZ1 subset) remain unconfirmed. In addition, we find that the fraction of unconfirmed clusters close to the galactic plane (at |b|{\textless}25deg) is greater than that at higher galactic latitudes (|b|{\textgreater}25deg), which indicates contamination produced by radio emission of galactic dust and gas clouds on these SZ detections. In fact, in the majority of the cases, we detect important galactic cirrus in the optical images, mainly in the SZ target located at low galactic latitudes, which supports this hypothesis.},

abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) slitless grism spectroscopy of 28 emission-line galaxies at z {\~{}} 2, in the GOODS-S region of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey. The high sensitivity of these grism observations, with {\textgreater}1$\sigma$ detections of emission lines to f {\textgreater} 2.5 × 10-18 erg s-1 cm-2, means that the galaxies in the sample are typically {\~{}}7 times less massive (median M * = 109.5 M ⊙) than previously studied z {\~{}} 2 emission-line galaxies. Despite their lower mass, the galaxies have [O III]/H$\beta$ ratios which are very similar to previously studied z {\~{}} 2 galaxies and much higher than the typical emission-line ratios of local galaxies. The WFC3 grism allows for unique studies of spatial gradients in emission lines, and we stack the two-dimensional spectra of the galaxies for this purpose. In the stacked data the [O III] emission line is more spatially concentrated than the H$\beta$ emission line with 98.1{\%} confidence. We additionally stack the X-ray data (all sources are individually undetected), and find that the average L [O III]/L 0.5-10 keV ratio is intermediate between typical z {\~{}} 0 obscured active galaxies and star-forming galaxies. Together the compactness of the stacked [O III] spatial profile and the stacked X-ray data suggest that at least some of these low-mass, low-metallicity galaxies harbor weak active galactic nuclei.

abstract = {The third generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) took data from 2008 to 2014 using the original SDSS wide-field imager, the original and an upgraded multi-object fiber-fed optical spectrograph, a new near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph, and a novel optical interferometer. All the data from SDSS-III are now made public. In particular, this paper describes Data Release 11 (DR11) including all data acquired through 2013 July, and Data Release 12 (DR12) adding data acquired through 2014 July (including all data included in previous data releases), marking the end of SDSS-III observing. Relative to our previous public release (DR10), DR12 adds one million new spectra of galaxies and quasars from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) over an additional 3000 sq. deg of sky, more than triples the number of H-band spectra of stars as part of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and includes repeated accurate radial velocity measurements of 5500 stars from the Multi-Object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS). The APOGEE outputs now include measured abundances of 15 different elements for each star. In total, SDSS-III added 5200 sq. deg of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of the Sloan Exploration of Galactic Understanding and Evolution 2 (SEGUE-2) survey; 2,497,484 BOSS spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216 stars over 9376 sq. deg; 618,080 APOGEE spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040 MARVELS spectra of 5,513 stars. Since its first light in 1998, SDSS has imaged over 1/3 the Celestial sphere in five bands and obtained over five million astronomical spectra.},

abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

@article{Cappellari2011,
abstract = {We look at the morphology of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies. Edge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. They appear like spiral galaxies with the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals with disky isophotes. Fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range of bulge fractions as spiral galaxies. The slow rotators are rounder and are generally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, elliptical galaxies. We propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by Hubble as it gives a misleading description of ETGs. We study for the first time the kinematic morphology-density T-Sigma relation using fast and slow rotators to replace lenticulars and ellipticals. We find that our relation is cleaner than using classic morphology. Slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest density environments [f(SR){\textless}2{\%}] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(SR){\~{}}4{\%}] of the total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, with the exception of the densest core of the Virgo cluster [f(SR){\~{}}20{\%}]. We find a clean log-linear relation between the fraction f(Sp) of spiral galaxies and the local galaxy surface density. The existence of a smooth kinematic T-Sigma relation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment as main contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators in low-density environments. It shows that the segregation is driven by local effects at the small-group scale. Only at the largest densities in the Virgo core does the f(Sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while the fraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. This suggests that a different mechanism is at work there. (Abridged)},

abstract = {We take advantage of the largest high-resolution simulation of cosmic structure growth ever carried out - the Millennium Simulation of the concordance $\Lambda$ cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogony - to study how the star formation histories, ages and metallicities of elliptical galaxies depend on environment and on stellar mass. We concentrate on a galaxy formation model which is tuned to fit the joint luminosity/colour/morphology distribution of low-redshift galaxies. Massive ellipticals in this model have higher metal abundances, older luminosity-weighted ages and shorter star formation time-scales, but lower assembly redshifts, than less massive systems. Within clusters the typical masses, ages and metal abundances of ellipticals are predicted to decrease, on average, with increasing distance from the cluster centre. We also quantify the effective number of progenitors of ellipticals as a function of present stellar mass, finding typical numbers below two for M* {\textless} 1011Msolar, rising to approximately five for the most massive systems. These findings are consistent with recent observational results that suggest `down-sizing' or `antihierarchical' behaviour for the star formation history of the elliptical galaxy population, despite the fact that our model includes all the standard elements of hierarchical galaxy formation and is implemented on the standard, $\Lambda$CDM cosmogony.},

abstract = {We tested the performance of photometric redshifts for galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep field down to 30th magnitude. We compared photometric redshift estimates from three spectral fitting codes from the literature (EAZY, BPZ and BEAGLE) to high quality redshifts for 1227 galaxies from the MUSE integral field spectrograph. All these codes can return photometric redshifts with bias |Dzn|=|z-z{\_}phot|/(1+z){\textless}0.05 down to F775W=30 and spectroscopic incompleteness is unlikely to strongly modify this statement. We have, however, identified clear systematic biases in the determination of photometric redshifts: in the 0.4{\textless}z{\textless}1.5 range, photometric redshifts are systematically biased low by as much as Dzn=-0.04 in the median, and at z{\textgreater}3 they are systematically biased high by up to Dzn = 0.05, an offset that can in part be explained by adjusting the amount of intergalactic absorption applied. In agreement with previous studies we find little difference in the performance of the different codes, but in contrast to those we find that adding extensive ground-based and IRAC photometry actually can worsen photo-z performance for faint galaxies. We find an outlier fraction, defined through |Dzn|{\textgreater}0.15, of 8{\%} for BPZ and 10{\%} for EAZY and BEAGLE, and show explicitly that this is a strong function of magnitude. While this outlier fraction is high relative to numbers presented in the literature for brighter galaxies, they are very comparable to literature results when the depth of the data is taken into account. Finally, we demonstrate that while a redshift might be of high confidence, the association of a spectrum to the photometric object can be very uncertain and lead to a contamination of a few percent in spectroscopic training samples that do not show up as catastrophic outliers, a problem that must be tackled in order to have sufficiently accurate photometric redshifts for future cosmological surveys.},

abstract = {Observational work conducted over the past few decades indicates that all massive galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centres. Although the luminosities and brightness fluctuations of quasars in the early Universe suggest that some were powered by black holes with masses greater than 10 billion solar masses, the remnants of these objects have not been found in the nearby Universe. The giant elliptical galaxy Messier 87 hosts the hitherto most massive known black hole, which has a mass of 6.3 billion solar masses. Here we report that NGC 3842, the brightest galaxy in a cluster at a distance from Earth of 98 megaparsecs, has a central black hole with a mass of 9.7 billion solar masses, and that a black hole of comparable or greater mass is present in NGC 4889, the brightest galaxy in the Coma cluster (at a distance of 103 megaparsecs). These two black holes are significantly more massive than predicted by linearly extrapolating the widely used correlations between black-hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion or bulge luminosity of the host galaxy. Although these correlations remain useful for predicting black-hole masses in less massive elliptical galaxies, our measurements suggest that different evolutionary processes influence the growth of the largest galaxies and their black holes.},

Our sample, from an area of 504 square degrees centered on the celestial equator, is divided into two regions. The main region uses 270 square degrees of the ACT survey that overlaps with the co-added ugriz imaging from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) over Stripe 82 plus additional near-infrared pointed observations with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5-meter telescope. We confirm a total of 49 clusters to z{\~{}}1.3, of which 22 (all at z{\textgreater}0.55) are new discoveries. For the second region the regular-depth SDSS imaging allows us to confirm 19 more clusters up to z{\~{}}0.7, of which 10 systems are new. We present the optical richness, photometric redshifts, and separation between the SZ position and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We find no significant offset between the cluster SZ centroid and BCG location and a weak correlation between optical richness and SZ-derived mass. We also present X-ray fluxes and luminosities from the ROSAT All Sky Survey which confirm that this is a massive sample. One of the newly discovered clusters, ACT-CL J0044.4+0113 at z=1.1 (photometric), has an integrated XMM-Newton X-ray temperature of kT{\_}x=7.9+/-1.0 keV and combined mass of M{\_}200a=8.2(-2.5,+3.3)x10{\^{}}14 M{\_}sun/h70 placing it among the most massive and X-ray-hot clusters known at redshifts beyond z=1.

abstract = {We use HST/WFC3 imaging from the CANDELS Multi-Cycle Treasury Survey, in conjunction with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to explore the evolution of galactic structure for galaxies with stellar masses {\textgreater}3 × 1010 M ⊙ from z = 2.2 to the present epoch, a time span of 10 Gyr. We explore the relationship between rest-frame optical color, stellar mass, star formation activity, and galaxy structure. We confirm the dramatic increase from z = 2.2 to the present day in the number density of non-star-forming galaxies above 3 × 1010 M ⊙ reported by others. We further find that the vast majority of these quiescent systems have concentrated light profiles, as parameterized by the S{\'{e}}rsic index, and the population of concentrated galaxies grows similarly rapidly. We examine the joint distribution of star formation activity, S{\'{e}}rsic index, stellar mass, inferred velocity dispersion, and stellar surface density. Quiescence correlates poorly with stellar mass at all z {\textless} 2.2. Quiescence correlates well with S{\'{e}}rsic index at all redshifts. Quiescence correlates well with "velocity dispersion" and stellar surface density at z {\textgreater} 1.3, and somewhat less well at lower redshifts. Yet, there is significant scatter between quiescence and galaxy structure: while the vast majority of quiescent galaxies have prominent bulges, many of them have significant disks, and a number of bulge-dominated galaxies have significant star formation. Noting the rarity of quiescent galaxies without prominent bulges, we argue that a prominent bulge (and perhaps, by association, a supermassive black hole) is an important condition for quenching star formation on galactic scales over the last 10 Gyr, in qualitative agreement with the active galactic nucleus feedback paradigm.},

abstract = {We present aperture-matched PSF-corrected BVi'z'JH photometry and Bayesian photometric redshifts (BPZ) for objects detected in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF), 8,042 of which are detected at the 10-sigma level (e.g., i'{\textless}29.01 or z'{\textless}28.43). Most of our objects are defined identically to those in the public STScI catalogs, enabling straightforward object-by-object comparison. We have combined detections from i', z', J+H, and B+V+i'+z' images into a single comprehensive segmentation map. Using a new program called SExSeg we are able to force this segmentation map into SExtractor for photometric analysis. The resulting photometry is corrected for the wider NIC3 PSFs using our ColorPro software. We also correct for the ACS z'-band PSF halo. The NIC3 magnitudes are found to be too faint relative to the ACS fluxes. Based on BPZ SED fits to objects of know spectroscopic redshift, we derived corrections of -0.30 +/- 0.03 mag in J and -0.18 +/- 0.04 mag in H. The offsets appear to be supported by a recent recalibration of the UDF NIC3 images combined with non-linearity measured in NICMOS itself. The UDF reveals a large population of faint blue galaxies (presumably young starbursts), bluer than those observed in the original Hubble Deep Fields (HDF). To accommodate these galaxies, we have added two new starburst templates to the SED library used in previous BPZ papers. The resulting photometric redshifts are accurate to within 0.04 * 1+z{\_}spec out to z {\textless} 6. Finally, we measure galaxy morphology, including Sersic index and asymmetry.

abstract = {This is the third paper in a series which combines N-body simulations and semi-analytic modelling to provide a fully spatially resolved simulation of the galaxy formation and clustering processes. Here we extract mock redshift surveys from our simulations: a cold dark matter model with either Omega{\_}0=1 (tauCDM) or Omega{\_}0=0.3 and Lambda=0.7 (LambdaCDM). We compare the mock catalogues with the northern region (CfA2N) of the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) Redshift Surveys. We study the properties of galaxy groups and clusters identified using standard observational techniques, and also the relation of these groups to real virialized systems. Most features of CfA2N groups are reproduced quite well by both models with no obvious dependence on Omega{\_}0. Redshift-space correlations and pairwise velocities are also similar in the two cosmologies. The luminosity functions predicted by our galaxy formation models depend sensitively on the treatment of star formation and feedback. For the particular choices of Paper I they agree poorly with the CfA survey. To isolate the effect of this discrepancy on our mock redshift surveys, we modify galaxy luminosities in our simulations to reproduce the CfA luminosity function exactly. This adjustment improves agreement with the observed abundance of groups, which depends primarily on the galaxy luminosity density, but other statistics, connected more closely with the underlying mass distribution, remain unaffected. Regardless of the luminosity function adopted, modest differences with observation remain. These can be attributed to the presence of the `Great Wall' in the CfA2N. It is unclear whether the greater coherence of the real structure is a result of cosmic variance, given the relatively small region studied, or reflects a physical deficiency of the models.},

Using {\$}\backslashsim\backslash! 130,000{\$} galaxy pairs patterned after the SDSS redMaPPer cluster sample study of Rozo et al.

Through joint membership matching, we deconstruct the main Gaussian velocity component into its halo contributions, finding that the top-ranked halo contributes {\$}\backslashsim 60\backslash{\%}{\$} of the stacked signal. The halo mass scale inferred by applying the virial scaling of Evrard et al.

We apply this approach, along with mis-centering and galaxy velocity bias corrections, to estimate the log-mean matched halo mass at {\$}z=0.2{\$} of SDSS redMaPPer clusters.

@article{Bullock2010,
abstract = {We predict that there is a population of low-luminosity dwarf galaxies orbiting within the halo of the Milky Way that have surface brightnesses low enough to have escaped detection in star-count surveys. The overall count of stealth galaxies is sensitive to the presence (or lack) of a low-mass threshold in galaxy formation. These systems have luminosities and stellar velocity dispersions that are similar to those of known ultrafaint dwarf galaxies but they have more extended stellar distributions (half light radii greater than about 100 pc) because they inhabit dark subhalos that are slightly less massive than their higher surface brightness counterparts. As a result, the typical peak surface brightness is fainter than 30 mag per square arcsec. One implication is that the inferred common mass scale for Milky Way dwarfs may be an artifact of selection bias. If there is no sharp threshold in galaxy formation at low halo mass, then ultrafaint galaxies like Segue 1 represent the high-mass, early forming tail of a much larger population of objects that could number in the hundreds and have typical peak circular velocities of about 8 km/s and masses within 300 pc of about 5 million solar masses. Alternatively, if we impose a low-mass threshold in galaxy formation in order to explain the unexpectedly high densities of the ultrafaint dwarfs, then we expect only a handful of stealth galaxies in the halo of the Milky Way. A complete census of these objects will require deeper sky surveys, 30m-class follow-up telescopes, and more refined methods to identify extended, self-bound groupings of stars in the halo.},

We analyze the galaxy velocity field in extended regions up to 7 h-1 Mpc from cluster centers, and we estimate mean velocity dispersions and their radial dependence. Only one from a total of 41 Abell clusters does not correspond to a dynamically bound system. However, four of these bound objects are double clusters. We estimate that 20{\%} (seven clusters) of the 35 remaining are subject to serious projection effects. Normalizing the clustercentric distances by means of the overdensity radius r200, and the velocity dispersion profiles (VDPs) by the corresponding mean cluster velocity dispersion, we computed the average VDP. Our results indicate a flat behavior of the mean VDP at large distances from the cluster center. Nevertheless, we found that for the inner part of the clusters (r/r200{\textless}=1) the VDP is up to 10{\%} smaller than at larger radii.

abstract = {With the goal of investigating the degree to which the MIR emission traces the SFR, we analyze Spitzer 8 and 24 $\mu$m data of star-forming regions in a sample of 33 nearby galaxies with available HST NICMOS images in the Pa$\alpha$ (1.8756 $\mu$m) emission line. The galaxies are drawn from the SINGS sample and cover a range of morphologies and a factor {\~{}}10 in oxygen abundance. Published data on local low-metallicity starburst galaxies and LIRGs are also included in the analysis. Both the stellar continuum-subtracted 8 $\mu$m emission and the 24 $\mu$m emission correlate with the extinction-corrected Pa$\alpha$ line emission, although neither relationship is linear. Simple models of stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproduce the observed nonlinear trend of the 24 $\mu$m emission versus number of ionizing photons, including the modest deficiency of 24 $\mu$m emission in the low-metallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dust opacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. Conversely, the trend of the 8 $\mu$m emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not well reproduced by the same models. The 8 $\mu$m emission is contributed, in larger measure than the 24 $\mu$m emission, by dust heated by nonionizing stellar populations, in addition to the ionizing ones, in agreement with previous findings. Two SFR calibrations, one using the 24 $\mu$m emission and the other using a combination of the 24 $\mu$m and H$\alpha$ luminosities (Kennicutt and coworkers), are presented. No calibration is presented for the 8 $\mu$m emission because of its significant dependence on both metallicity and environment. The calibrations presented here should be directly applicable to systems dominated by ongoing star formation.

In agreement with previous work, their half-light radii are {\textless}2 kpc, much smaller than equally massive galaxies in the present-day universe. A significant subset of the sample appears highly flattened in projection, which implies, considering viewing angle statistics, that a significant fraction of the galaxies in our sample have pronounced disks. This is corroborated by two-dimensional surface brightness profile fits. We estimate that 65{\%} ± 15{\%} of the population of massive, quiescent z {\~{}} 2 galaxies are disk dominated. The median disk scale length is 1.5 kpc, substantially smaller than the disks of equally massive galaxies in the present-day universe.

We complement the optical measurements with archival XMM-Newton and ROSAT X-ray data which provide additional luminosity and mass constraints on a modest fraction of the cluster sample. Two of our clusters show clear evidence for central lensing arcs; one of these has a spectacular large-diameter, nearly-complete Einstein Ring surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy. A strong motivation for this study is to identify the massive clusters that are expected to display prominent signals from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect (SZE) and therefore be detected in the wide-area mm-band surveys being conducted by both the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope. The optical sample presented here will be useful for verifying new SZE cluster candidates from these surveys, for testing the cluster selection function, and for stacking analyzes of the SZE data.},

abstract = {We present H$\alpha$ integral field spectroscopy of well-resolved, UV/optically selected z{\~{}}2 star-forming galaxies as part of the SINS survey with SINFONI on the ESO VLT. Our laser guide star adaptive optics and good seeing data show the presence of turbulent rotating star-forming outer rings/disks, plus central bulge/inner disk components, whose mass fractions relative to the total dynamical mass appear to scale with the [N II]/H$\alpha$ flux ratio and the star formation age. We propose that the buildup of the central disks and bulges of massive galaxies at z{\~{}}2 can be driven by the early secular evolution of gas-rich proto-disks. High-redshift disks exhibit large random motions. This turbulence may in part be stirred up by the release of gravitational energy in the rapid ``cold'' accretion flows along the filaments of the cosmic web. As a result, dynamical friction and viscous processes proceed on a timescale of {\textless}1 Gyr, at least an order of magnitude faster than in z{\~{}}0 disk galaxies. Early secular evolution thus drives gas and stars into the central regions and can build up exponential disks and massive bulges, even without major mergers. Secular evolution along with increased efficiency of star formation at high surface densities may also help to account for the short timescales of the stellar buildup observed in massive galaxies at z{\~{}}2.

@article{Faltenbacher2006,
abstract = {We employ a high-resolution dissipationless N-body simulation of a galaxy cluster to investigate the impact of subhalo selection on the resulting velocity distributions. Applying a lower limit on the present bound mass of subhalos leads to high subhalo velocity dispersions compared to the diffuse dark matter (positive velocity bias) and to a considerable deviation from a Gaussian velocity distribution (kurtosis -0.6). However, if subhalos are required to exceed a minimal mass before accretion onto the host, the velocity bias becomes negligible and the velocity distribution is close to Gaussian (kurtosis -0.15). Recently it has been shown that the latter criterion results in subhalo samples that agree well with the observed number-density profiles of galaxies in clusters. Therefore we argue that the velocity distributions of galaxies in clusters are essentially un-biased. The comparison of the galaxy velocity distribution and the sound speed, derived from scaling relations of X-ray observations, results in an average Mach number of 1.24. Altogether 65{\%} of the galaxies move supersonically and 8{\%} have Mach numbers larger than 2 with respect to the intra cluster gas.},

abstract = {We investigate the properties of galaxies between the blue and the red sequence (i.e. the transition region, 4.5 {\textless} NUV - H {\textless} 6mag) by combining ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared imaging to 21-cm HI line observations for a volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies. We confirm the existence of a tight relation between colour and HI fraction across all the range of colours, although outside the blue cloud this trend becomes gradually weaker. Transition galaxies are divided into two different families, according to their atomic hydrogen content. `HI-deficient' galaxies are the majority of transition galaxies in our sample. They are found in high-density environments and all their properties are consistent with a quenching of the star formation via gas stripping. However, while the migration from the blue cloud is relatively quick (i.e. {\textless}{\~{}}1Gyr), a longer amount of time (a few Gyr at least) seems required to completely suppress the star formation and reach the red sequence. At all masses, migrating `HI-deficient' galaxies are mainly discs, implying that the mechanism responsible for today's migration in clusters cannot have played a significant role in the creation of the red sequence at high redshift. Conversely, `HI-normal' transition galaxies are a more heterogeneous population. A significant fraction of these objects show star formation in ring-like structures and evidence for accretion/minor-merging events suggesting that at least part of the HI reservoir has an external origin. The detailed evolution of such systems is still unclear, but our analysis suggests that, in at least two cases, galaxies might have migrated back from the red sequence after accretion events. Interestingly, the HI available may be sufficient to sustain star formation at the current rate for several billion years. Our study clearly shows the variety of evolutionary paths leading to the transition region and suggests that the transition galaxies may not be always associated with systems quickly migrating from the blue to the red sequence.},

Finally, we present the derived cluster mass functions, estimate the systematic uncertainties in this measurement, and discuss the calculation of the likelihood function. We confidently measure the evolution in the cluster comoving number density at a fixed mass threshold, e.g., by a factor of 5.0 ± 1.2 at M 500 = 2.5 × 1014 h -1 M sun between z = 0 and 0.5. This evolution reflects the growth of density perturbations, and can be used for the cosmological constraints complementing those from the distance-redshift relation.},

abstract = {The Hubble Deep Fields continue to be a valuable resource for studying the distant universe, particularly at z{\textgreater}2 where their comoving volume becomes large enough to encompass several hundred L* galaxies or their progenitors. Here I present recent results from a near-infrared imaging survey of the HDF-North with NICMOS, which provides structural and photometric information in the optical rest frame (4000-5500A) for hundreds of ordinary galaxies at 2{\textless}z{\textless}3, and which offers the means to search for still more distant objects at z{\textgreater}{\textgreater}5. Lyman break galaxies at 2{\textless}z{\textless}3 are compact and often irregular in the NICMOS images; ordinary Hubble sequence spirals and ellipticals seem to be largely absent at these redshifts, and apparently reached maturity at 1{\textless}z{\textless}2. The Lyman break galaxies have UV-optical spectral energy distributions like those of local starburst galaxies. Population synthesis models suggest typical ages {\~{}}few x 10{\^{}}8 years and moderate UV extinction ({\~{}}1.2 mag at 1700A), but the constraints are fairly weak and there may be considerable variety. Considering a near-IR selected galaxy sample, there is little evidence for a significant number of galaxies at z{\~{}}3 that have been missed by UV-based Lyman break selection. Using the well-characterized z{\~{}}3 galaxy population as a point of reference, I consider Lyman break galaxy candidates at 4.5{\textless}z{\textless}9, as well as one remarkable object which might (or might not) be at z{\textgreater}12. The space density of UV-bright galaxies in the HDF appears to thin out toward larger redshifts, although surface brightness selection effects may play an important role.},

Star color-color, number counts, and PSF size versus modeled size plots show that the modeling of the PSF is good enough for precision five-band photometry.

abstract = {We present results of a large survey of the mid-infrared (mid-IR) properties of 248 Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) with confirmed spectroscopic redshift using deep Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) observations in six cosmological fields. By combining the new mid-IR photometry with optical and near-infrared observations, we model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) employing a revised version of the Bruzual and Charlot synthesis population code that incorporates a new treatment of the thermal-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase (CB07). Our primary aim is to investigate the impact of the AGB phase in the stellar masses of the LBGs, and compare our new results with previous stellar mass estimates. We investigate the stellar mass of the LBG population as a whole and assess the benefits of adding longer wavelengths to estimates of stellar masses for high-redshift galaxies. Based on the new CB07 code, we find that the stellar masses of LBGs are smaller on an average by a factor of {\~{}}1.4 compared to previous estimates. LBGs with 8 and/or 24$\mu$m detections show higher masses (M* {\~{}} 1011Msolar) than LBGs faint in the IRAC bands (M* {\~{}} 109Msolar). The ages of these massive LBGs are considerably higher than the rest of the population, indicating that they have been star forming for at least {\~{}}1 Gyr. We also show how the addition of the IRAC bands improves the accuracy of the estimated stellar masses and reduced the scatter on the derived mass-to-light ratios. In particular, we present a tight correlation between the 8$\mu$m IRAC band (rest-frame K for galaxies at z {\~{}} 3) and the stellar mass. We calculate the number density of massive (M* {\textgreater} 1011Msolar) LBGs and find it to be $\Phi$ = (1.12 +/- 0.4) × 10-5Mpc-3, {\~{}}1.5 times lower than that found by previous studies. Finally, based on ultraviolet-corrected star formation rates (SFRs), we investigate the SFR-stellar mass correlation at z {\~{}} 3, find it similar to the one observed at other redshifts and show that our data place the peak of the evolution of the specific SFR at z {\~{}} 3.},

In addition, our ML approaches are only dependent on parent halo properties (like HOD methods), which are advantageous over subhalo-based approaches as identifying subhalos correctly is difficult. We test 2 algorithms: support vector machines (SVM) and k-nearest-neighbour (kNN) regression. We take galaxies and halos from the Millennium simulation and predict N{\_}gal by training our algorithms on the following 6 halo properties: number of particles, M{\_}200, $\backslash$sigma{\_}v, v{\_}max, half-mass radius and spin. For Millennium, our predicted N{\_}gal values have a mean-squared-error (MSE) of {\~{}}0.16 for both SVM and kNN. Our predictions match the overall distribution of halos reasonably well and the galaxy correlation function at large scales to {\~{}}5-10{\%}. In addition, we demonstrate a feature selection algorithm to isolate the halo parameters that are most predictive, a useful technique for understanding the mapping between halo properties and N{\_}gal. Lastly, we investigate these ML-based approaches in making mock catalogs for different galaxy subpopulations (e.g. blue, red, high M{\_}star, low M{\_}star). Given its non-parametric nature as well as its powerful predictive and feature selection capabilities, machine learning offers an interesting alternative for creating mock catalogs.},

abstract = {We present the results of the deepest search to date for star-forming galaxies beyond a redshift z {\~{}}= 8.5 utilizing a new sequence of near-infrared Wide-Field Camera 3 (WFC3/IR) images of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF). This "UDF12" campaign completed in 2012 September doubles the earlier exposures with WFC3/IR in this field and quadruples the exposure in the key F105W filter used to locate such distant galaxies. Combined with additional imaging in the F140W filter, the fidelity of high-redshift candidates is greatly improved. Using spectral energy distribution fitting techniques on objects selected from a deep multi-band near-infrared stack, we find seven promising z {\textgreater} 8.5 candidates. As none of the previously claimed UDF candidates with 8.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 10 are confirmed by our deeper multi-band imaging, our campaign has transformed the measured abundance of galaxies in this redshift range. Although we recover the candidate UDFj-39546284 (previously proposed at z = 10.3), it is undetected in the newly added F140W image, implying that it lies at z = 11.9 or is an intense emission line galaxy at z {\~{}}= 2.4. Although no physically plausible model can explain the required line intensity given the lack of Ly$\alpha$ or broadband UV signal, without an infrared spectrum we cannot rule out an exotic interloper. Regardless, our robust z {\~{}}= 8.5-10 sample demonstrates a luminosity density that continues the smooth decline observed over 6 {\textless} z {\textless} 8. Such continuity has important implications for models of cosmic reionization and future searches for z {\textgreater}10 galaxies with James Webb Space Telescope.},

We select a sample of 563 massive (M {\textgreater} 1010 M ⊙), passively evolving (specific star formation rate {\textless}10-2 Gyr-1), and morphologically spheroidal galaxies at 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5, using the panchromatic photometry and spectroscopic redshifts available in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Surveys fields. We combine Advanced Camera for Surveys and Wide Field Camera 3 Hubble Space Telescope images to study the morphology of our galaxies in their optical rest frame in the entire 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 range. We find that throughout the explored redshift range the passive galaxies selected with our criteria have weak morphological K-correction, with size being slightly smaller in the optical than in the UV rest frame (by {\~{}}20{\%} and {\~{}}10{\%} at z {\textgreater} 1.2 and z {\textless} 1.2, respectively). We measure a significant evolution of the mass-size relation of ETGs, with a fractional increment that is almost independent of the stellar mass. ETGs formed at z {\textgreater} 1 appear to be preferentially small, and the evolution of the mass-size relation at z {\textless} 1 is driven by both the continuous size growth of the compact galaxies and the appearance of new ETGs with large sizes. We also find that the number density of all passive ETGs increases rapidly, by a factor of five, from z {\~{}} 2 to z {\~{}} 1, and then more mildly by another factor of 1.5 from z {\~{}} 1 to z {\~{}} 0. We interpret these results as evidence that the bulk of the ETGs are formed at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 3 through a mechanism that leaves very compact remnants. At z {\textless} 1 the compact ETGs grow gradually in size, becoming normal-size galaxies, and at the same time new ETGs with normal-large sizes are formed.

abstract = {We present initial results of a survey for star-forming galaxies in the redshift range 3.8{\textless}{\~{}}z{\textless}{\~{}}4.5. This sample consists of a photometric catalog of 244 galaxies culled from a total solid angle of 0.23 deg{\^{}}2 to an apparent magnitude of I{\_}AB=25.0. Spectroscopic redshifts in the range 3.61{\textless}=z{\textless}=4.81 have been obtained for 48 of these galaxies; their median redshift is {\textless}z{\textgreater}=4.13. Selecting these galaxies in a manner entirely analogous to our large survey for Lyman-break galaxies at smaller redshift (2.7{\textless}{\~{}}z{\textless}{\~{}}3.4) allows a relatively clean differential comparison between the populations and integrated luminosity density at these two cosmic epochs. Over the same range of UV luminosity, the spectroscopic properties of the galaxy samples at z{\~{}}4 and z{\~{}}3 are indistinguishable, as are the luminosity function shapes and the total integrated UV luminosity densities [rho{\_}UV(z=3)/rho{\_}UV(z=4)=1.1+/-0.3]. We see no evidence at these bright magnitudes for the steep decline in the star formation density inferred from fainter photometric Lyman-break galaxies in the Hubble deep field (HDF). The HDF provides the only existing data on Lyman-break galaxy number densities at fainter magnitudes. We have reanalyzed the z{\~{}}3 and z{\~{}}4 Lyman-break galaxies in the HDF using our improved knowledge of the spectral energy distributions of these galaxies, and we find, like previous authors, that faint Lyman-break galaxies appear to be rarer at z{\~{}}4 than z{\~{}}3. This might signal a large change in the faint-end slope of the Lyman-break galaxy luminosity function between redshifts z{\~{}}3 and z{\~{}}4, or, more likely, be due to significant variance in the number counts within the small volumes probed by the HDF at high redshifts ({\~{}}160 times smaller than the ground-based surveys discussed here). If the true luminosity density at z{\~{}}4 is somewhat higher than implied by the HDF, as our ground-based sample suggests, then the emissivity of star formation as a function of redshift would appear essentially constant for all z{\textgreater}1 once internally consistent corrections for dust are made. This suggests that there may be no obvious peak in star formation activity and that the onset of substantial star formation in galaxies might occur at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}4.5.},

We focus on the luminosity of the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare with those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[OIII]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early types. The hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high-luminosity AGN have strong H$\delta$ absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and quasars (QSOs) with the same [OIII] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [OIII] luminosities.},

The survey consists of 42 orbits of F160W imaging covering {\~{}}65 arcmin2 distributed widely across the sky and reaching a depth of 27.9 AB for a 5$\sigma$ detection within a 0.2 arcsec radius aperture. Focusing on an optically selected sample of 306 star-forming galaxies with stellar masses in the range M * = 109-1011 M ⊙, we find that typical circularized effective half-light radii range from {\~{}}0.7 to 3.0 kpc and describe a stellar mass-radius relation as early as z {\~{}} 3. While these galaxies are best described by an exponential surface brightness profile (S{\'{e}}rsic index n {\~{}} 1), their distribution of axis ratios is strongly inconsistent with a population of inclined exponential disks and is better reproduced by triaxial stellar systems with minor/major and intermediate/major axis ratios {\~{}}0.3 and 0.7, respectively. While rest-UV and rest-optical morphologies are generally similar for a subset of galaxies with HST/Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging data, differences are more pronounced at higher masses M * {\textgreater} 3 × 1010 M ⊙. Finally, we discuss galaxy morphology in the context of efforts to constrain the merger fraction, finding that morphologically identified mergers/non-mergers generally have insignificant differences in terms of physical observables such as stellar mass and star formation rate, although merger-like galaxies selected according to some criteria have statistically smaller effective radii and correspondingly larger $\Sigma$SFR.

abstract = {This paper studies the properties of kiloparsec-scale clumps in star-forming galaxies at z{\~{}}2 through multi-wavelength broad band photometry. A sample of 40 clumps is identified through auto-detection and visual inspection from 10 galaxies with 1.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.5 in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, where deep and high-resolution HST/WFC3 and ACS images enable us to resolve structures of z{\~{}}2 galaxies down to kpc scale in the rest-frame UV and optical bands as well as to detect clumps toward the faint end. The physical properties of clumps are measured through fitting spatially resolved seven-band (BVizYJH) spectral energy distribution to models. On average, the clumps are blue and have similar median rest-frame UV--optical color as the diffuse components of their host galaxies, but the clumps have large scatter in their colors. Although the star formation rate (SFR)--stellar mass relation of galaxies is dominated by the diffuse components, clumps emerge as regions with enhanced specific SFRs, contributing individually {\~{}}10{\%} and together {\~{}}50{\%} of the SFR of the host galaxies. However, the contributions of clumps to the rest-frame UV/optical luminosity and stellar mass are smaller, typically a few percent individually and {\~{}}20{\%} together. On average, clumps are younger by 0.2 dex and denser by a factor of 8 than diffuse components. Clump properties have obvious radial variations in the sense that central clumps are redder, older, more extincted, denser, and less active on forming stars than outskirts clumps. Our results are broadly consistent with a widely held view that clumps are formed through gravitational instability in gas-rich turbulent disks and would eventually migrate toward galactic centers and coalesce into bulges. Roughly 40{\%} of the galaxies in our sample contain a massive clump that could be identified as a proto-bulge, which seems qualitatively consistent with such a bulge-formation scenario.},

abstract = {Substructure in galaxy clusters can be quantified with the robust Delta statistics (Dressler and Shectman 1988) which uses velocity kinematics and sky projected positions. We test its sensitivity using dissipationless numerical simulations of cluster formation. As in recent observations, about 30 {\%} of the simulated clusters show substructure, but the exact percentage depends on the chosen limit for defining substructure, and a better discriminator is the distribution function of the Delta statistics. The Dressler-Shectman statistics correlate well with other subcluster indicators, but with large scatter due to its sensitivity to small infalling groups and projection effects.},

abstract = {In this review, we describe our current understanding of cluster formation: from the general picture of collapse from initial density fluctuations in an expanding Universe to detailed simulations of cluster formation including the effects of galaxy formation. We outline both the areas in which highly accurate predictions of theoretical models can be obtained and areas where predictions are uncertain due to uncertain physics of galaxy formation and feedback. The former includes the description of the structural properties of the dark matter halos hosting cluster, their mass function and clustering properties. Their study provides a foundation for cosmological applications of clusters and for testing the fundamental assumptions of the standard model of structure formation. The latter includes the description of the total gas and stellar fractions, the thermodynamical and non-thermal processes in the intracluster plasma. Their study serves as a testing ground for galaxy formation models and plasma physics. In this context, we identify a suitable radial range where the observed thermal properties of the intra-cluster plasma exhibit the most regular behavior and thus can be used to define robust observational proxies for the total cluster mass. We put particular emphasis on examining assumptions and limitations of the widely used self-similar model of clusters. Finally, we discuss the formation of clusters in non-standard cosmological models, such as non-Gaussian models for the initial density field and models with modified gravity, along with prospects for testing these alternative scenarios with large cluster surveys in the near future.},

@article{Overzier2010,
abstract = {Previous work has shown that Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) display a range in structures (from single and compact to more clumpy and extended) that is different from typical local star-forming galaxies. Recently, we have introduced a sample of rare, nearby (z {\textless} 0.3) starburst galaxies that appear to be good analogs of LBGs. These "Lyman break analogs" (LBAs) provide an excellent training set for understanding starbursts at different redshifts. We present an application of this by comparing the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and optical morphologies of 30 LBAs with those of galaxies at z {\~{}} 2-4 in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. We compare LBAs with star-forming sBzK galaxies at z {\~{}} 2, and LBGs at z {\~{}} 3-4 at the same intrinsic UV luminosity (L UV {\textgreater}{\~{}} 0.3L* z=3). The UV/optical colors and sizes of LBAs and LBGs are very similar, while the BzK galaxies are somewhat redder and larger. LBAs lie along a mass-metallicity relation that is offset from that of typical local galaxies, but similar to that seen at z {\~{}} 2. There is significant overlap between the morphologies (G, C, A, and M 20) of the local and high-redshift samples, although the high-redshift samples are somewhat less concentrated and clumpier than the LBAs. Based on their highly asymmetric morphologies, we find that in the majority of LBAs the starbursts appear to be triggered by interactions/mergers. When the images of the LBAs are degraded to the same sensitivity and linear resolution as the images of LBGs and BzK galaxies, we find that these relatively faint asymmetric features are no longer detectable. This effect is particularly severe in the rest-frame UV. It has been suggested that high-redshift galaxies experience intense bursts unlike anything seen in the local universe, possibly due to cold flows and instabilities. In part, this is based on the fact that the majority ({\~{}}70{\%}) of LBGs do not show morphological signatures of interactions or mergers. Our results suggest that this evidence is insufficient, since a large fraction of such signatures would likely have been missed in current observations of galaxies at z {\~{}} 2-4. This leaves open the possibility that clumpy accretion and mergers remain important in driving the evolution of these starbursts, together with rapid gas accretion through other means.},

abstract = {We present the ROSAT All-Sky Survey Bright Source Catalogue (RASS-BSC, revision 1RXS) derived from the all-sky survey performed during the first half year (1990/91) of the ROSAT mission. 18,811 sources are catalogued (i) down to a limiting ROSAT PSPC count-rate of 0.05 cts/s in the 0.1-2.4 keV energy band, (ii) with a detection likelihood of at least 15 and (iii) at least 15 source counts. The 18,811 sources underwent both an automatic validation and an interactive visual verification process in which for 94{\%} of the sources the results of the standard processing were confirmed. The remaining 6{\%} have been analyzed using interactive methods and these sources have been flagged. Flags are given for (i) nearby sources; (ii) sources with positional errors; (iii) extended sources; (iv) sources showing complex emission structures; and (v) sources which are missed by the standard analysis software. Broad band (0.1-2.4 keV) images are available for sources flagged by (ii), (iii) and (iv). For each source the ROSAT name, position in equatorial coordinates, positional error, source count-rate and error, background count-rate, exposure time, two hardness-ratios and errors, extent and likelihood of extent, likelihood of detection, and the source extraction radius are provided. At a brightness limit of 0.1 cts/s (8,547 sources) the catalogue represents a sky coverage of 92{\%}.

abstract = {We present direct observational evidence for star formation quenching in galaxy groups in the redshift range 0{\textless}z{\textless}2.5. We utilize a large sample of nearly 6000 groups, selected by fixed cumulative number density from three photometric catalogs, to follow the evolving quiescent fractions of central and satellite galaxies over roughly 11 Gyr. At z{\~{}}0, central galaxies in our sample range in stellar mass from Milky Way/M31 analogs (M=6.5x10{\^{}}10 M$\backslash$solar) to nearby massive ellipticals (M=1.5x10{\^{}}11 M$\backslash$solar). Satellite galaxies in the same groups reach masses as low as twice that of the Large Magellanic Cloud (M=6.5x10{\^{}}9 M$\backslash$solar). Using statistical background subtraction, we measure the average rest-frame colors of galaxies in our groups and calculate the evolving quiescent fractions of centrals and satellites over seven redshift bins. Our analysis shows clear evidence for star formation quenching in group halos, with a different quenching onset for centrals and their satellite galaxies. Using halo mass estimates for our central galaxies, we find that star formation shuts off in centrals when typical halo masses reach between 10{\^{}}12 and 10{\^{}}13 M$\backslash$solar, consistent with predictions from the halo quenching model. In contrast, satellite galaxies in the same groups most likely undergo quenching by environmental processes, whose onset is delayed with respect to their central galaxy. Although star formation is suppressed in all galaxies over time, the processes that govern quenching are different for centrals and satellites. While mass plays an important role in determining the star formation activity of central galaxies, quenching in satellite galaxies is dominated by the environment in which they reside.},

The sample includes both data from the literature and the new ESO Nearby Abell Clusters Survey (ENACS) data. On the assumption that mass follows the galaxy distribution, we compute the mass of each cluster by applying the virial theorem to the member galaxies. We constrain the masses of very substructured clusters (about 10{\%} of our clusters) between two limiting values. After appropriate rescaling to the X-ray radii, we compare our optical mass estimates to those derived from X-ray analyses, which we compiled from the literature (for 66 clusters). We find a good overall agreement. This agreement is expected in the framework of two common assumptions: that mass follows the galaxy distribution and that clusters are not far from a situation of dynamical equilibrium, with both gas and galaxies reflecting the same underlying mass distribution. We stress that our study strongly supports the reliability of present cluster mass estimates derived from X-ray analyses and/or (appropriate) optical analyses.},

This approach, in which a relatively simple, inexpensive, unit spectrograph is copied in large numbers, offers significant savings of engineering effort, cost, and schedule when compared to traditional instruments. The main motivator for VIRUS is to map the evolution of dark energy for the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) using 0.8M Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting galaxies as tracers. The full VIRUS array is due to be deployed by early 2014 and will provide a powerful new facility instrument for the HET, well suited to the survey niche of the telescope.

abstract = {We present a first measurement of the stellar mass component of galaxy clusters selected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, using 3.6 um and 4.5 um photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our sample consists of 14 clusters detected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which span the redshift range 0.27 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.07 (median z = 0.50), and have dynamical mass measurements, accurate to about 30 per cent, with median M500 = 6.9 x 10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}} MSun. We measure the 3.6 um and 4.5 um galaxy luminosity functions, finding the characteristic magnitude (m*) and faint-end slope (alpha) to be similar to those for IR-selected cluster samples. We perform the first measurements of the scaling of SZ-observables (Y500 and y0) with both brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) stellar mass and total cluster stellar mass (M500star). We find a significant correlation between BCG stellar mass and Y500 (E(z){\^{}}{\{}-2/3{\}} DA{\^{}}2 Y500 {\~{}} M*{\^{}}{\{}1.2 +/- 0.6{\}}), although we are not able to obtain a strong constraint on the slope of the relation due to the small sample size. Additionally, we obtain E(z){\^{}}{\{}-2/3{\}} DA{\^{}}2 Y500 {\~{}} M500star{\^{}}{\{}1.0 +/- 0.6{\}} for the scaling with total stellar mass. The mass fraction in stars spans the range 0.006-0.034, with the second ranked cluster in terms of dynamical mass (ACT-CL J0237-4939) having an unusually low total stellar mass and the lowest stellar mass fraction. For the five clusters with gas mass measurements available in the literature, we see no evidence for a shortfall of baryons relative to the cosmic mean value.},

abstract = {This work attains a threefold objective: first, we derived the richness-mass scaling in the local Universe from data of 53 clusters with individual measurements of mass. We found a 0.46+-0.12 slope and a 0.25+-0.03 dex scatter measuring richness with a previously developed method. Second, we showed on a real sample of 250 0.06{\textless}z{\textless}0.9 clusters, most of which are at z{\textless}0.3, with spectroscopic redshift that the colour of the red sequence allows us to measure the clusters' redshift to better than Delta z=0.02. Third, we computed the predicted prior of the richness-mass scaling to forecast the capabilities of future wide-field-area surveys of galaxy clusters to constrain cosmological parameters. We computed the uncertainty and the covariance matrix of the (evolving) richness-mass scaling of a PanStarrs 1+Euclid-like survey accounting for a large suite of sources of errors. We find that the richness-mass scaling parameters, which are the input ingredients of cosmological forecasts using cluster counts, can be determined 10{\^{}}5 times better than estimated in previous works that did not use weak-lensing mass estimates. The better knowledge of the scaling parameters likely has a strong impact on the relative importance of the different probes used to constrain cosmological parameters. Richness-mass scaling parameters were recovered, but only if the cluster mass function and the weak-lensing redshift-dependent selection function were accounted for in the fitting of the mass-richness scaling. This emphasizes the limitations of often adopted simplifying assumptions, such as having a mass-complete redshift-independent sample. The fitting code used for computing the predicted prior, including the treatment of the mass function and of the weak-lensing selection function, is provided in the appendix. [Abridged]},

abstract = {X-ray and radio observations of CIZA J2242.8+5301 suggest that it is a major cluster merger. Despite being well studied in the X-ray and radio, little has been presented on the cluster structure and dynamics inferred from its galaxy population. We carried out a deep (i$\backslash$lt 25) broadband imaging survey of the system with Subaru SuprimeCam (g and i bands) and the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope (r band), as well as a comprehensive spectroscopic survey of the cluster area (505 redshifts) using Keck DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph. We use these data to perform a comprehensive galaxy/redshift analysis of the system, which is the first step to a proper understanding of the geometry and dynamics of the merger, as well as using the merger to constrain self-interacting dark matter. We find that the system is dominated by two subclusters of comparable richness with a projected separation of 6$\backslash$buildrel{\{} $\backslash$prime{\}}$\backslash$over{\{}.{\}} 9-0.5+0.7 (1.3-0.10+0.13 Mpc). We find that the north and south subclusters have similar redshifts of z≈ 0.188 with a relative line-of-sight (LOS) velocity difference of 69 ± 190 km {\{}{\{}s{\}}-1{\}}. We also find that north and south subclusters have velocity dispersions of 1160-90+100 and 1080-70+100 km {\{}{\{}s{\}}-1{\}}, respectively. These correspond to masses of 16.1-3.3+4.6× {\{}{\{}10{\}}14{\}} and 13.0-2.5+4.0× {\{}{\{}10{\}}14{\}} {\{}{\{}M{\}}ȯ {\}}, respectively. While velocity dispersion measurements of merging clusters can be biased, we believe the bias in this system to be minor due to the large projected separation and nearly plane-of-sky merger configuration. We also find that the cDs of the north and south subclusters are very near their subcluster centers, in both projection (55 and 85 kpc, respectively) and normalized LOS velocity (|{\{}$\Delta$ {\}}v|/{\{}{\{}$\sigma$ {\}}v{\}}=0.43+/- 0.13 and 0.21 ± 0.12 for the north and south, respectively). CIZA J2242.8+5301 is a relatively clean dissociative cluster merger with near 1:1 mass ratio, which makes it an ideal merger for studying merger-associated physical phenomena.},

abstract = {We present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as a function of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the Planck SZ (PSZ) catalogue. The PSZ is selected through the signature of the Sunyaev--Zeldovich (SZ) effect, and the sub-sample used here has a signal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster and all but one with a redshift estimate. We discuss the calculation of the expected cluster counts as a function of cosmological parameters, the completeness of the sample, and the likelihood construction method. Using a relation between mass M and SZ signal Y based on comparison to X-ray measurements, we derive constraints on the power spectrum amplitude sigma{\_}8 and matter density parameter $\backslash$Omega{\_}m in a flat LCDM model. We test the robustness of our estimates and find that possible biases in the Y-M relation and the halo mass function appear larger than the statistical uncertainties from the cluster sample. Assuming a bias between the X-ray determined mass and the true mass of 20{\%}, motivated by comparison of the observed mass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we find that sigma{\_}8(Omega{\_}m/0.27){\^{}}0.3=0.78+-0.01, with one-dimensional ranges sigma{\_}8=0.77+-0.02 and Omega{\_}m=0.29+-0.02. The values of the cosmological parameters are degenerate with the mass bias, and it is found that the larger values of sigma{\_}8 and Omega{\_}m preferred by the Planck's measurements of the primary CMB anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass bias of about 45{\%}. Alternatively, consistency with the primary CMB constraints can be achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scales, such as a component of massive neutrinos. We place our results in the context of other determinations of cosmological parameters, and discuss issues that need to be resolved in order to make progress in this field.},

abstract = {We present the ROSAT All-Sky Survey Bright Source Catalogue (RASS-BSC, revision 1RXS) derived from the all-sky survey performed during the first half year (1990/91) of the ROSAT mission. 18,811 sources are catalogued (i) down to a limiting ROSAT PSPC count-rate of 0.05 cts/s in the 0.1-2.4 keV energy band, (ii) with a detection likelihood of at least 15 and (iii) at least 15 source counts. The 18,811 sources underwent both an automatic validation and an interactive visual verification process in which for 94{\%} of the sources the results of the standard processing were confirmed. The remaining 6{\%} have been analyzed using interactive methods and these sources have been flagged. Flags are given for (i) nearby sources; (ii) sources with positional errors; (iii) extended sources; (iv) sources showing complex emission structures; and (v) sources which are missed by the standard analysis software. Broad band (0.1-2.4 keV) images are available for sources flagged by (ii), (iii) and (iv). For each source the ROSAT name, position in equatorial coordinates, positional error, source count-rate and error, background count-rate, exposure time, two hardness-ratios and errors, extent and likelihood of extent, likelihood of detection, and the source extraction radius are provided. At a brightness limit of 0.1 cts/s (8,547 sources) the catalogue represents a sky coverage of 92{\%}. The RASS-BSC, the table of possible identification candidates, and the broad band images are available in electronic form (Voges et al. 1996a) via http://wave.xray.mpe.mpg.de/rosat/catalogues/rass-bsc .},

abstract = {We address the origin of the robust bimodality observed in galaxy properties about a characteristic stellar mass {\~{}}3 × 1010Msolar. Less massive galaxies tend to be ungrouped blue star forming discs, while more massive galaxies are typically grouped red old-star spheroids. Colour-magnitude data show a gap between the red and blue sequences, extremely red luminous galaxies already at z{\~{}} 1, a truncation of today's blue sequence above L*, and massive starbursts at z{\~{}} 2-4. We propose that these features are driven by the thermal properties of the inflowing gas and their interplay with the clustering and feedback processes, all functions of the dark matter halo mass and associated with a similar characteristic scale. In haloes below a critical shock-heating mass Mshock{\textless}{\~{}} 1012Msolar, discs are built by cold streams, not heated by a virial shock, yielding efficient early star formation. It is regulated by supernova feedback into a long sequence of bursts in blue galaxies constrained to a `fundamental line'. Cold streams penetrating through hot media in M{\textgreater}=Mshock haloes preferentially at z{\textgreater}= 2 lead to massive starbursts in L {\textgreater} L* galaxies. At z {\textless} 2, in M {\textgreater} Mshock haloes hosting groups, the gas is heated by a virial shock, and being dilute it becomes vulnerable to feedback from energetic sources such as active galactic nuclei. This shuts off gas supply and prevents further star formation, leading by passive evolution to `red-and-dead' massive spheroids starting at z{\~{}} 1. A minimum in feedback efficiency near Mshock explains the observed minimum in M/L and the qualitative features of the star formation history. The cold flows provide a hint for solving the angular momentum problem. When these processes are incorporated in simulations they recover the main bimodality features and solve other open puzzles.},

abstract = {We use N-body/photometric galaxy simulations to examine the impact of sample variance of spectroscopic redshift samples on the accuracy of photometric redshift (photo-z) determination and calibration of photo-z errors. We estimate the biases in the cosmological parameter constraints from weak lensing and derive requirements on the spectroscopic follow-up for three different photo-z algorithms chosen to broadly span the range of algorithms available. We find that sample variance is much more relevant for the photo-z error calibration than for photo-z training, implying that follow-up requirements are similar for different algorithms. We demonstrate that the spectroscopic sample can be used for training of photo-zs and error calibration without incurring additional bias in the cosmological parameters. We provide a guide for observing proposals for the spectroscopic follow-up to ensure that redshift calibration biases do not dominate the cosmological parameter error budget. For example, assuming optimistically (pessimistically) that the weak lensing shear measurements from the Dark Energy Survey could obtain 1-sigma constraints on the dark energy equation of state w of 0.035 (0.055), implies a follow-up requirement of 150 (40) patches of sky with a telescope such as Magellan, assuming a 1/8{\^{}}2 deg effective field of view and 400 galaxies per patch. Assuming (optimistically) a VVDS-like spectroscopic completeness with purely random failures, this could be accomplished with about 75 (20) nights of observation. For more realistic assumptions regarding spectroscopic completeness, or in the presence of other sources of systematics not considered here, further degradations to dark energy constraints are possible. We test several approaches for reducing the requirements. Abridged},

abstract = {PHOTOMETRYPIPELINE (PP) is an automated pipeline that produces calibrated photometry from imaging data through image registration, aperture photometry, photometric calibration, and target identification with only minimal human interaction. PP utilizes the widely used Source Extractor software for source identification and aperture photometry; SCAMP is used for image registration. Both image registration and photometric calibration are based on matching field stars with star catalogs, requiring catalog coverage of the respective field. A number of different astrometric and photometric catalogs can be queried online. Relying on a sufficient number of background stars for image registration and photometric calibration, PP is well-suited to analyze data from small to medium-sized telescopes. Calibrated magnitudes obtained by PP are typically accurate within 0.03 mag and astrometric accuracies are of the order of 0.3 arcsec relative to the catalogs used in the registration. The pipeline consists of an open-source software suite written in Python 2.7, can be run on Unix-based systems on a simple desktop machine, and is capable of realtime data analysis. PP has been developed for observations of moving targets, but can be used for analyzing point source observations of any kind.},

abstract = {The distribution of galaxies in position and velocity around the centers of galaxy clusters encodes important information about cluster mass and structure. Using the maxBCG galaxy cluster catalog identified from imaging data obtained in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we study the BCG-galaxy velocity correlation function. By modeling its non-Gaussianity, we measure the mean and scatter in velocity dispersion at fixed richness. The mean velocity dispersion increases from 202+/-10 km s-1 for small groups to more than 854+/-102 km s-1 for large clusters. We show the scatter to be at most 40.5{\%}+/-3.5{\%}, declining to 14.9{\%}+/-9.4{\%} in the richest bins. We test our methods in the C4 cluster catalog, a spectroscopic cluster catalog produced from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR2 spectroscopic sample, and in mock galaxy catalogs constructed from N-body simulations. Our methods are robust, measuring the scatter to well within 1 $\sigma$ of the true value, and the mean to within 10{\%}, in the mock catalogs. By convolving the scatter in velocity dispersion at fixed richness with the observed richness space density function, we measure the velocity dispersion function of the maxBCG galaxy clusters. Although velocity dispersion and richness do not form a true mass-observable relation, the relationship between velocity dispersion and mass is theoretically well characterized and has low scatter. Thus, our results provide a key link between theory and observations up to the velocity bias between dark matter and galaxies.},

abstract = {Galaxies with stellar masses near M* contain the majority of stellar mass in the universe, and are therefore of special interest in the study of galaxy evolution. The Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) have present day stellar masses near M*, at 5x10{\^{}}10 Msol (MW-mass) and 10{\^{}}11 Msol (M31-mass). We study the typical progenitors of these galaxies using ZFOURGE, a deep medium-band near-IR imaging survey, which is sensitive to the progenitors of these galaxies out to z{\~{}}3. We use abundance-matching techniques to identify the main progenitors of these galaxies at higher redshifts. We measure the evolution in the stellar mass, rest-frame colors, morphologies, far-IR luminosities, and star-formation rates combining our deep multiwavelength imaging with near-IR HST imaging from CANDELS, and far-IR imaging from GOODS-H and CANDELS-H. The typical MW-mass and M31-mass progenitors passed through the same evolution stages, evolving from blue, star-forming disk galaxies at the earliest stages, to redder dust-obscured IR-luminous galaxies in intermediate stages, and to red, more quiescent galaxies at their latest stages. The progenitors of the MW-mass galaxies reached each evolutionary stage at later times (lower redshifts) and with stellar masses that are a factor of 2-3 lower than the progenitors of the M31-mass galaxies. The process driving this evolution, including the suppression of star-formation in present-day M* galaxies requires an evolving stellar-mass/halo-mass ratio and/or evolving halo-mass threshold for quiescent galaxies. The effective size and star-formation rates imply that the baryonic cold-gas fractions drop as galaxies evolve from high redshift to z{\~{}}0 and are strongly anticorrelated with an increase in the S$\backslash$'ersic index. Therefore, the growth of galaxy bulges in M* galaxies corresponds to a rapid decline in the galaxy gas fractions and/or a decrease in the star-formation efficiency.},

VIRUS-P was commissioned in 2007, is in regular service on the McDonald Observatory 2.7 m Smith telescope, and offers the largest field of any integral field spectrograph. The 246-fiber IFU uses a densepak-type fiber bundle with a 1/3 fill factor. It is fed at f/3.65 through a telecentric, two-group dioptric focal reducer. The spectrograph's double-Schmidt optical design uses a volume phase holographic grating at the pupil between the articulating f/3.32 folded collimator and the f/1.33 cryogenic prime focus camera. High on-sky throughput is achieved with this catadioptric system by the use of high reflectivity dielectric coatings, which set the 340-670 nm bandwidth. VIRUS-P is gimbal-mounted on the telescope to allow short fibers for high UV throughput, while maintaining high mechanical stability. The instrument software and the 18 square arcmin field, fixed-offset guider provide rapid acquisition, guiding, and precision dithering to fill in the IFU field. Custom software yields Poisson noise limited, sky subtracted spectra. The design characteristics are described that achieved uniformly high image quality with low scattered light and fiber-to-fiber cross talk. System throughput exceeds requirements and peaks at 40{\%}. The observing procedures are described, and example observations are given.},

These methods are doubly complementary: they constrain different combinations of cosmological model parameters and are subject to different systematic errors. By deriving the four sets of measurements from the same data set with a common analysis framework, we will obtain important cross checks of the systematic errors and thereby make a substantial and robust advance in the precision of dark energy measurements.},

abstract = {We have analysed the growth of Brightest Group Galaxies and Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BGGs/BCGs) over the last 3 billion years using a large sample of 883 galaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey. By comparing the stellar mass of BGGs and BCGs in groups and clusters of similar dynamical masses, we find no significant growth between redshift z = 0.27 and 0.09. We also examine the number of BGGs/BCGs that have line emission, finding that approximately 65 per cent of BGGs/BCGs show H$\alpha$ in emission. From the galaxies where the necessary spectroscopic lines were accurately recovered (54 per cent of the sample), we find that half of this (i.e. 27 per cent of the sample) harbour ongoing star formation with rates up to 10 M⊙ yr-1, and the other half (i.e. 27 per cent of the sample) have an active nucleus (AGN) at the centre. BGGs are more likely to have ongoing star formation, while BCGs show a higher fraction of AGN activity. By examining the position of the BGGs/BCGs with respect to their host dark matter halo, we find that around 13 per cent of them do not lie at the centre of the dark matter halo. This could be an indicator of recent cluster-cluster mergers. We conclude that BGGs and BCGs acquired their stellar mass rapidly at higher redshifts as predicted by semi-analytic models, mildly slowing down at low redshifts.},

abstract = {We point out a natural mechanism for quenching of star formation in early-type galaxies (ETGs). It automatically links the color of a galaxy with its morphology and does not require gas consumption, removal or termination of gas supply. Given that star formation takes place in gravitationally unstable gas disks, it can be quenched when a disk becomes stable against fragmentation to bound clumps. This can result from the growth of a stellar spheroid, for instance by mergers. We present the concept of morphological quenching (MQ) using standard disk instability analysis, and demonstrate its natural occurrence in a cosmological simulation using an efficient zoom-in technique. We show that the transition from a stellar disk to a spheroid can be sufficient to stabilize the gas disk, quench star formation, and turn an ETG red and dead while gas accretion continues. The turbulence necessary for disk stability can be stirred up by sheared perturbations within the disk in the absence of bound star-forming clumps. While other quenching mechanisms, such as gas stripping, active galactic nucleus feedback, virial shock heating, and gravitational heating are limited to massive halos, MQ can explain the appearance of red ETGs also in halos less massive than {\~{}}1012 M sun. The dense gas disks observed in some of today's red ellipticals may be the relics of this mechanism, whereas red galaxies with quenched gas disks could be more frequent at high redshift.},

abstract = {We present constraints on cosmological parameters based on a sample of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich-selected (SZ-selected) galaxy clusters detected in a millimeter-wave survey by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The cluster sample used in this analysis consists of nine optically confirmed high-mass clusters comprising the high-significance end of the total cluster sample identified in 455 deg2 of sky surveyed during 2008 at 148 GHz. We focus on the most massive systems to reduce the degeneracy between unknown cluster astrophysics and cosmology derived from SZ surveys. We describe the scaling relation between cluster mass and SZ signal with a four-parameter fit. Marginalizing over the values of the parameters in this fit with conservative priors gives $\sigma$8 = 0.851 ± 0.115 and w = -1.14 ± 0.35 for a spatially flat wCDM cosmological model with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) seven-year priors on cosmological parameters. This gives a modest improvement in statistical uncertainty over WMAP seven-year constraints alone. Fixing the scaling relation between the cluster mass and SZ signal to a fiducial relation obtained from numerical simulations and calibrated by X-ray observations, we find $\sigma$8 = 0.821 ± 0.044 and w = -1.05 ± 0.20. These results are consistent with constraints from WMAP7 plus baryon acoustic oscillations plus Type Ia supernova which give $\sigma$8 = 0.802 ± 0.038 and w = -0.98 ± 0.053. A stacking analysis of the clusters in this sample compared to clusters simulated assuming the fiducial model also shows good agreement. These results suggest that, given the sample of clusters used here, both the astrophysics of massive clusters and the cosmological parameters derived from them are broadly consistent with current models.},

abstract = {We combine high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 images with multi-wavelength photometry to track the evolution of structure and activity of massive (M sstarf {\textgreater} 1010 M ⊙) galaxies at redshifts z = 1.4-3 in two fields of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey. We detect compact, star-forming galaxies (cSFGs) whose number densities, masses, sizes, and star formation rates (SFRs) qualify them as likely progenitors of compact, quiescent, massive galaxies (cQGs) at z = 1.5-3. At z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2, cSFGs present SFR = 100-200 M ⊙ yr-1, yet their specific star formation rates (sSFR {\~{}} 10-9 yr-1) are typically half that of other massive SFGs at the same epoch, and host X-ray luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) 30 times ({\~{}}30{\%}) more frequently. These properties suggest that cSFGs are formed by gas-rich processes (mergers or disk-instabilities) that induce a compact starburst and feed an AGN, which, in turn, quench the star formation on dynamical timescales (few 108 yr). The cSFGs are continuously being formed at z = 2-3 and fade to cQGs down to z {\~{}} 1.5. After this epoch, cSFGs are rare, thereby truncating the formation of new cQGs. Meanwhile, down to z = 1, existing cQGs continue to enlarge to match local QGs in size, while less-gas-rich mergers and other secular mechanisms shepherd (larger) SFGs as later arrivals to the red sequence. In summary, we propose two evolutionary tracks of QG formation: an early (z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2), formation path of rapidly quenched cSFGs fading into cQGs that later enlarge within the quiescent phase, and a late-arrival (z {\textless}{\~{}} 2) path in which larger SFGs form extended QGs without passing through a compact state.},

abstract = {We study the structural evolution of massive galaxies by linking progenitors and descendants at a constant cumulative number density of n c = 1.4 × 10-4 Mpc-3 to z {\~{}} 3. Structural parameters were measured by fitting S{\'{e}}rsic profiles to high-resolution CANDELS HST WFC3 J 125 and H 160 imaging in the UKIDSS-UDS at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 3 and ACS I 814 imaging in COSMOS at 0.25 {\textless} z {\textless} 1. At a given redshift, we selected the HST band that most closely samples a common rest-frame wavelength so as to minimize systematics from color gradients in galaxies. At fixed n c, galaxies grow in stellar mass by a factor of {\~{}}3 from z {\~{}} 3 to z {\~{}} 0. The size evolution is complex: galaxies appear roughly constant in size from z {\~{}} 3 to z {\~{}} 2 and then grow rapidly to lower redshifts. The evolution in the surface mass density profiles indicates that most of the mass at r {\textless} 2 kpc was in place by z {\~{}} 2, and that most of the new mass growth occurred at larger radii. This inside-out mass growth is therefore responsible for the larger sizes and higher S{\'{e}}rsic indices of the descendants toward low redshift. At z {\textless} 2, the effective radius evolves with the stellar mass as re vpropM 2.0, consistent with scenarios that find dissipationless minor mergers to be a key driver of size evolution. The progenitors at z {\~{}} 3 were likely star-forming disks with re {\~{}} 2 kpc, based on their low S{\'{e}}rsic index of n {\~{}} 1, low median axis ratio of b/a {\~{}} 0.52, and typical location in the star-forming region of the U - V versus V - J diagram. By z {\~{}} 1.5, many of these star-forming disks disappeared, giving rise to compact quiescent galaxies. Toward lower redshifts, these galaxies continued to assemble mass at larger radii and became the local ellipticals that dominate the high-mass end of the mass function at the present epoch.

All structures are confirmed using the DBSCAN method, including the detection of nine structures previously reported in the literature. We present a catalogue of all structures present including their central position, mean redshift, velocity dispersions, and classification based on their morphological and spectroscopic distributions. In particular we find 13 galaxy clusters and 6 large groups/small clusters. Comparison of these massive structures with published XMM-Newton imaging (where available) shows that {\$}80\backslash{\%}{\$} of these structures are associated with diffuse, soft-band (0.4 - 1 keV) X-ray emission including {\$}90\backslash{\%}{\$} of all objects classified as clusters.

These results all provide strong support for hierarchical structure formation up to redshifts of 1.},

abstract = {We present a simple theoretical framework for massive galaxies at high redshift, where the main assembly and star formation occurred, and report on the first cosmological simulations that reveal clumpy disks consistent with our analysis. The evolution is governed by the interplay between smooth and clumpy cold streams, disk instability, and bulge formation. Intense, relatively smooth streams maintain an unstable dense gas-rich disk. Instability with high turbulence and giant clumps, each a few percent of the disk mass, is self-regulated by gravitational interactions within the disk. The clumps migrate into a bulge in lsim10 dynamical times, or lsim0.5 Gyr. The cosmological streams replenish the draining disk and prolong the clumpy phase to several Gigayears in a steady state, with comparable masses in disk, bulge, and dark matter within the disk radius. The clumps form stars in dense subclumps following the overall accretion rate, {\~{}}100 M sun yr-1, and each clump converts into stars in {\~{}}0.5 Gyr. While the clumps coalesce dissipatively to a compact bulge, the star-forming disk is extended because the incoming streams keep the outer disk dense and susceptible to instability and because of angular momentum transport. Passive spheroid-dominated galaxies form when the streams are more clumpy: the external clumps merge into a massive bulge and stir up disk turbulence that stabilize the disk and suppress in situ clump and star formation. We predict a bimodality in galaxy type by z {\~{}} 3, involving giant-clump star-forming disks and spheroid-dominated galaxies of suppressed star formation. After z {\~{}} 1, the disks tend to be stabilized by the dominant stellar disks and bulges. Most of the high-z massive disks are likely to end up as today's early-type galaxies.},

The galaxy sample is derived using a sophisticated Lyman-Break technique on the full two-year WFC3/IR and ACS data available over the HUDF09 ({\~{}}29.4 AB mag, 5 sigma), two nearby HUDF09 fields ({\~{}}29 AB mag, 14 arcmin) and the wider area ERS ({\~{}}27.5 AB mag) {\~{}}40 arcmin**2). The application of strict optical non-detection criteria ensures the contamination fraction is kept low (just {\~{}}7{\%} in the HUDF). This very low value includes a full assessment of the contamination from lower redshift sources, photometric scatter, AGN, spurious sources, low mass stars, and transients (e.g., SNe). From careful modelling of the selection volumes for each of our search fields we derive luminosity functions for galaxies at z{\~{}}7 and z{\~{}}8 to {\textless}-18 AB mag. The faint-end slopes alpha at z{\~{}}7 and z{\~{}}8 are uncertain but very steep at alpha = -2.01+/-0.21 and alpha=-1.91+/-0.32, respectively. Such steep slopes contrast to the local alpha{\textless}{\~{}}-1.4 and may even be steeper than that at z{\~{}}4 where alpha=-1.73+/-0.05. With such steep slopes (alpha{\textless}{\~{}}-1.7) lower luminosity galaxies dominate the galaxy luminosity density during the epoch of reionization. The star formation rate densities derived from these new z{\~{}}7 and z{\~{}}8 luminosity functions are consistent with the trends found at later times (lower redshifts). We find reasonable consistency, with the SFR densities implied from reported stellar mass densities, being only {\~{}}40{\%} higher at z{\textless}7. This suggests that (1) the stellar mass densities inferred from the Spitzer IRAC photometry are reasonably accurate and (2) that the IMF at very high redshift may not be very different from that at later times.},

One sample is constructed with emphasis on the completeness of the sample, while the advantage of the other is the use of the temperature profiles, derived with ASCA. We obtain remarkably similar fits to the M-T relation for both samples, with the normalization and the slope significantly different from both prediction of self-similar collapse and hydrodynamical simulations. We discuss the origin of these discrepancies and also combine the X-ray mass with velocity dispersion measurements to provide a comparison with high-resolution dark matter simulations. Finally, we discuss the importance of a cluster formation epoch in the observed M-T relation.},

abstract = {We perform a measurement of the mass--richness relation of the redMaPPer galaxy cluster catalogue using weak lensing data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We have carefully characterized a broad range of systematic uncertainties, including shear calibration errors, photo-{\$}z{\$} biases, dilution by member galaxies, source obscuration, magnification bias, incorrect assumptions about cluster mass profiles, cluster centering, halo triaxiality, and projection effects. We also compare measurements of the lensing signal from two independently-produced shear and photometric redshift catalogues to characterize systematic errors in the lensing signal itself. Using a sample of 5,570 clusters from {\$}0.1\backslashle z\backslashle 0.33{\$}, the normalization of our power-law mass vs.$\backslash$ {\$}\backslashlambda{\$} relation is {\$}\backslashlog{\_}{\{}10{\}}[M{\_}{\{}200m{\}}/h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}\backslash M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}]{\$} = {\$}14.344 \backslashpm 0.021{\$} (statistical) {\$}\backslashpm 0.023{\$} (systematic) at a richness {\$}\backslashlambda=40{\$}, a 7 per cent calibration uncertainty, with a power-law index of {\$}1.33{\^{}}{\{}+0.09{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.10{\}}{\$} ({\$}1\backslashsigma{\$}).

@article{Mantz2016,
abstract = {We present constraints on the scaling relations of galaxy cluster X-ray luminosity, temperature and gas mass (and derived quantities) with mass and redshift, employing masses from robust weak gravitational lensing measurements. These are the first such results obtained from an analysis that simultaneously accounts for selection effects and the underlying mass function, and directly incorporates lensing data to constrain total masses. Our constraints on the scaling relations and their intrinsic scatters are in good agreement with previous studies, and reinforce a picture in which departures from self-similar scaling laws are primarily limited to cluster cores. However, the data are beginning to reveal new features that have implications for cluster astrophysics and provide new tests for hydrodynamical simulations. We find a positive correlation in the intrinsic scatters of luminosity and temperature at fixed mass, which is related to the dynamical state of the clusters. While the evolution of the nominal scaling relations is consistent with self similarity, we find tentative evidence that the luminosity and temperature scatters respectively decrease and increase with redshift. Physically, this likely related to the development of cool cores and the rate of major mergers. We also examine the scaling relations of redMaPPer richness and Compton {\$}Y{\$} from Planck. While the richness--mass relation is in excellent agreement with recent work, the measured {\$}Y{\$}--mass relation departs strongly from that assumed in the Planck cluster cosmology analysis. The latter result is consistent with earlier comparisons of lensing and Planck scaling-relation-derived masses.},

abstract = {We have obtained the best fit to the light profiles of a luminosity- limited sample of elliptical and S0 galaxies with a power law r{\^{}}1/n{\^{}}, letting the exponent remain free rather than keeping it fixed at 1/n = 1/4 as in the well-known de Vaucouleurs formula. The introduction of a free parameter in the fitting formula (ranging from n = 0.5 for (r{\_}e{\_}) = 0.3 kpc to n = 16 for (r{\_}e{\_}) = 25 kpc) is justified by the existence of a good correlation between n and the global galaxian parameters, such as total luminosity and scale-radius. This result seems to be in line with the segregation of properties between the `ordinary' and `bright' families of early-type galaxies, and has consequences for the claimed independence of the shape of galaxy profiles with respect to the Fundamental Plane parameters.},

@article{Giavalisco1996,
abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope images of star-forming galaxies at redshifts z {\textgreater} 3. These galaxies have been selected using ground-based images and color criteria sensitive to the presence of a Lyman discontinuity in the otherwise flat (in fnu{\_} units) UV spectral energy distribution of unreddened star formation. The spectroscopic confirmation of these z {\textgreater} 3 galaxies is reported in a companion paper (Steidel et al.). The HST images, which probe the rest-frame UV between 1400 and 1900 A, show that the morphologies of the z {\textgreater} 3 galaxies are generally compact, although we find a few cases of more diffuse light profiles and several cases where the objects are comprised of multiple compact structures. Overall, the dispersion of morphological properties is relatively narrow, in contrast to the variety found in star-forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts (z {\~{}} 1). The galaxies with compact morphology are typically characterized by a small but resolved "core," approximately {\textless}{\~{}} 0.7 arcsec in radius, or about 5 h{\_}50{\_}{\^{}}-1{\^{}} (8.5 h{\_}50{\_}{\^{}}- 1{\^{}}) kpc with q{\_}0{\_} = 0.5 (0.05), and half-light radii of 0.2-0.3 arcsec, or 1.4-2.1 h{\_}50{\_}{\%}-1{\^{}}(2.4-3.6 h{\_}50{\_}{\^{}}-1{\^{}}) kpc. These sizes and scale lengths are similar to those of present-day bulges or intermediate-luminosity spheroids. The "cores" are often surrounded by lower surface brightness nebulosities, generally asymmetrically distributed. The minority of more diffuse galaxies do not possess this core, and an exponential function provides a very good fit to their light profiles. In contrast to highly elongated or irregular structures, such as "chain galaxies" that are found at z {\~{}} 1, the z {\textgreater} 3 galaxies are characterized by a relatively high degree of spherical symmetry. The morphological properties, space density, star-formation rates, masses, and early epoch of the star-formation phase all support the hypothesis that we have identified the progenitors of present-day luminous galaxies at the epoch when they were forming the stars of their spheroidal components.},

@article{Szomoru2011,
abstract = {We use ultradeep HST WFC3/IR imaging of the HUDF to investigate the rest-frame optical morphologies of a mass-selected sample of galaxies at z{\~{}}2. We find a large variety of galaxy morphologies, ranging from large, blue, disk-like galaxies to compact, red, early-type galaxies. We derive rest-frame u-g color profiles for these galaxies and show that most z{\~{}}2 galaxies in our sample have negative color gradients such that their cores are red. Although these color gradients may partly be caused by radial variations in dust content, they point to the existence of older stellar populations in the centers of z{\~{}}2 galaxies. This result is consistent with an "inside-out" scenario of galaxy growth. We find that the median color gradient is fairly constant with redshift: [Delta(u-g{\_}{\{}rest{\}})/Delta(log r)]{\_}{\{}median{\}} = -0.46, -0.44 and -0.49 for z{\~{}}2, z{\~{}}1 and z=0, respectively. Using structural parameters derived from surface brightness profiles we confirm that at z{\~{}}2 galaxy morphology correlates well with specific star formation rate. At the same mass, star forming galaxies have larger effective radii, bluer rest-frame u-g colors and lower Sersic indices than quiescent galaxies. These correlations are very similar to those at lower redshift, suggesting that the relations that give rise to the Hubble sequence at z=0 are already in place for massive galaxies at this early epoch.},
