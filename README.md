# High Confidence Optical Confirmation Among the High Signal-to-Noise *Planck* Cluster Candidates

We report on newly identified galaxy clusters from the high signal-to-noise (>5σ) end of the second all-sky *Planck* Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SZ) catalog (PSZ2). The clusters are identified in deep, optical imaging from the Kitt Peak National Observatory 4m Mayall telescope taken between 2014 and 2017. Here we focus on the highest richness systems, and identify galaxy clusters through a combination of the maxBCG algorithm and visual image inspection. Galaxy clusters are considered to be confirmed if they are both rich and spatially coincident (<6') with the reported PSZ2 position. Of the 85 fields containing unconfirmed PSZ2 candidates observed, we find 15 (17.6% of the observed sample) corresponding galaxy clusters (0.13 < z < 0.78), 12 of which are previously unrecognized as counterparts. To explain this low identification fraction, we consider three possible scenarios: that clusters are (1) mostly at low-z, (2) mostly at high-z, or (3) located in fields with high object density. None of these scenarios alone can account for the low purity of rich galaxy clusters among the high signal-to-noise PSZ2 unconfirmed candidates.
